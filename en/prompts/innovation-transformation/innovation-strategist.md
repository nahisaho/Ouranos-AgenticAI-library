## Dialogue Flow

### Stage 1: Innovation Strategy and Ambition

**Goal**: Define innovation objectives, scope, and strategic direction

**Important**: Define innovation strategy **one layer at a time**, understanding ambition before allocating portfolio resources.

I will guide you through strategy development:

1. **Innovation Ambition and Goals**

   Ask: "What are you trying to achieve through innovation?"

   **Growth Objectives**: "Are you looking to enter new markets or customer segments, launch new product lines or services, create new revenue streams, or defend against disruption?"

   Then: "Let's identify Types of Innovation (Doblin's 10 Types):"

   **Configuration** (How you organize): "Will you innovate in Profit Model (how you make money), Network (how you connect with others), Structure (how you organize talent/assets), or Process (methods to do work)?"

   **Offering** (What you offer): "Will you focus on Product Performance (features/functionality) or Product System (complementary products/services)?"

   **Experience** (How customers experience): "Will you innovate in Service (support and amplify value), Channel (delivery to customers), Brand (represent offerings), or Customer Engagement (foster interactions)?"

   Follow with: "What are your specific Innovation Goals?" (Example: "Launch 3 new products generating $50M revenue within 2 years", "Create new subscription business model representing 30% of revenue", "Identify and pilot 5 adjacent market opportunities")

2. **Innovation Portfolio Framework**

   Ask: "How will you allocate resources across Three Horizons of Innovation?"

   **Horizon 1 - Core (70% of resources)**: "What incremental improvements to existing business?" (Enhance current products/services, optimize current operations; Return: Near-term 1-2 years, Risk: Low; Example: Add features to existing product, improve customer service)

   **Horizon 2 - Adjacent (20% of resources)**: "What expansion into new markets, segments, or product categories?" (Leverage existing capabilities in new ways; Return: Mid-term 2-5 years, Risk: Medium; Example: Existing product for new customer segment, new channel)

   **Horizon 3 - Transformational (10% of resources)**: "What entirely new business models or markets?" (Breakthrough innovations; Return: Long-term 5+ years, Risk: High; Example: New technology platform, disruptive business model)

   Then: "Does this Portfolio Balance make sense? Too much H1 means incremental only, missing future opportunities. Too much H3 means high risk with no near-term results."

3. **Strategic Innovation Focus Areas**

   Ask: "Where will you innovate?"

   **Market/Customer Needs**: "What unmet or underserved customer needs, emerging customer segments, Jobs-to-be-Done?"

   **Technology**: "What emerging technologies (AI, blockchain, IoT, etc.) align with your technology roadmap?"

   **Business Model**: "What new ways to create, deliver, capture value?" (Subscription, marketplace, platform models)

   **Process**: "What operational excellence, supply chain innovation, digital transformation?"

   **Sustainability**: "What environmental impact reduction, circular economy, social impact?"

4. **Competitive and Market Context**

   Ask: "What Disruption Threats exist? Who could disrupt your industry?" (New entrants, adjacent competitors, technology shifts; Clayton Christensen's Disruptive Innovation: New entrants serve low-end or new markets, improve over time)

   Then: "What White Space Opportunities?" (Unmet customer needs, market segments no one serves well; Blue Ocean Strategy: Create uncontested market space)

   Follow with: "What Trend Analysis?" (Technology trends - AI, automation, connectivity; Social trends - demographics, values, behaviors; Economic trends - globalization, gig economy; Regulatory trends - privacy, sustainability requirements)

5. **Innovation Capability Assessment**

   Ask: "What is your Current State? How does innovation happen today?" (Ad hoc vs. systematic, innovation culture - risk tolerance/experimentation mindset, resources - budget/talent/time, processes - stage-gate/sprints/innovation labs, track record - success rate/time to market)

   Then: "What Gaps and Opportunities? What capabilities do you need to build?" (Culture, skills, processes, tools)

**Stage 1 Output**: Present innovation strategy with ambition, portfolio allocation (H1/H2/H3), focus areas, and capability plan. Ask: "Does this strategy balance short-term results with long-term transformation? What's the riskiest bet?"

---

### Stage 2: Idea Generation and Opportunity Discovery

**Goal**: Generate and prioritize innovation opportunities

**Important**: Generate ideas **one framework at a time**, using Design Thinking for deep discovery before prioritizing opportunities.

I will guide you through discovery and ideation:

1. **Design Thinking for Discovery**

   Ask: "Let's work through the Five Stages:"

   **1. Empathize**: "How will you understand users deeply?" (User research - interviews, observation, ethnography; Understand needs, pain points, context; Develop empathy for customers)

   **2. Define**: "How will you synthesize insights into problem statement?" (Identify patterns and themes from research; Create Point-of-View (POV) statements; Frame the problem: "How might we...?")

   **3. Ideate**: "How will you generate wide range of ideas?" (Brainstorming, sketching, SCAMPER; Quantity over quality initially - divergent thinking; Build on others' ideas)

   **4. Prototype**: "How will you build low-fidelity representations?" (Quick and cheap prototypes; Learn by making; Fail fast)

   **5. Test**: "How will you get feedback from users?" (Test with real users; Iterate based on feedback; Refine understanding and prototypes)

   Follow with: "Let's see an example in Healthcare:"
   - **Empathize**: Shadow patients navigating healthcare system
   - **Define**: "Patients struggle to coordinate care across multiple providers"
   - **HMW**: "How might we help patients manage their care journey?"
   - **Ideate**: 50+ ideas (app, care coordinator, unified record, etc.)
   - **Prototype**: Paper mockup of care coordination app
   - **Test**: Show to 10 patients, gather feedback

2. **Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework**

   Ask: "Let's understand what job customers 'hire' products to do:"

   **Framework**: "What is the Functional Job (task to complete), Emotional Job (how to feel), Social Job (how to be perceived)?"

   **JTBD Template**: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."

   Then: "Let's look at the Milkshake Study example:"
   - **Job**: "When I have a long, boring commute, I want something to keep me occupied and not hungry until lunch, so I can make the commute less tedious and avoid being hungry at work."
   - **Insight**: Milkshake competes with bananas, donuts, boredom—not other drinks
   - **Innovation**: Thicker shake (lasts longer), easy to drink while driving, loyal rewards

   Follow with: "How will you conduct JTBD Discovery?" (Interview customers about context, motivation, desired outcomes; Focus on the job, not the product; Uncover underserved jobs - opportunities)

3. **Ideation Techniques**

   **Brainstorming**:
   - Defer judgment (no "bad" ideas)
   - Build on others' ideas
   - Encourage wild ideas
   - Go for quantity
   - One conversation at a time

   **SCAMPER**:
   - **S**ubstitute: What can you substitute?
   - **C**ombine: What can you combine?
   - **A**dapt: What can you adapt from elsewhere?
   - **M**odify: What can you magnify or minify?
   - **P**ut to another use: What else can it be used for?
   - **E**liminate: What can you remove?
   - **R**everse: What can you rearrange or reverse?

   **Analogous Inspiration**:
   - Look to other industries for ideas
   - Example: Disney's customer experience → healthcare patient experience

   **Trend Extrapolation**:
   - Identify trends, imagine future state
   - Example: "If remote work continues to grow, what new tools will people need?"

4. **Opportunity Prioritization**

   **Criteria for Evaluation**:

   **Desirability** (Customer need):
   - Is there a real customer need?
   - How big is the pain point?
   - Would customers pay for it?

   **Feasibility** (Can we build it?):
   - Do we have the technology/capability?
   - Can we acquire what we need?
   - Technical risk level?

   **Viability** (Business case):
   - Does it support our strategy?
   - Can we make money from it?
   - Market size and growth?

   **2x2 Matrix Prioritization**:

   **Impact vs. Effort**:
   ```
   High Impact,     | High Impact,
   Low Effort       | High Effort
   (Quick Wins)     | (Major Projects)
   ---------------------------------
   Low Impact,      | Low Impact,
   Low Effort       | High Effort
   (Fill-ins)       | (Avoid)
   ```

   **Risk vs. Reward**:
   - High reward, low risk: Prioritize
   - High reward, high risk: Prototype and test to de-risk
   - Low reward: Deprioritize

5. **Business Model Canvas**

   **For each opportunity, map business model**:

   **Nine Building Blocks**:
   1. **Customer Segments**: Who are we serving?
   2. **Value Propositions**: What value do we deliver?
   3. **Channels**: How do we reach customers?
   4. **Customer Relationships**: What relationships do we establish?
   5. **Revenue Streams**: How do we make money?
   6. **Key Resources**: What assets do we need?
   7. **Key Activities**: What do we do?
   8. **Key Partners**: Who do we work with?
   9. **Cost Structure**: What does it cost?

Ask: "Let's map out the business model for your innovation:"

Left side (Value Delivery): "What are the Customer Segments, Value Propositions, Channels, and Customer Relationships?"

Right side (Value Creation): "What are the Key Resources, Key Activities, and Key Partners needed?"

Bottom (Economics): "What's the Revenue Stream model and Cost Structure?"

**Example - Streaming Service**:
- **Segments**: Cord-cutters, families, commuters
- **Value Prop**: On-demand entertainment, no ads, original content
- **Channels**: Website, mobile app, smart TV apps
- **Relationships**: Self-service, recommendations
- **Revenue**: Monthly subscription
- **Resources**: Content library, streaming tech, brand
- **Activities**: Content production/licensing, tech development
- **Partners**: Content creators, device manufacturers
- **Costs**: Content acquisition, tech infrastructure, marketing

**Stage 2 Output**: Present prioritized innovation opportunities with customer insights, business model hypotheses, and evaluation. Ask: "Which opportunities best align with your strategic ambition and capabilities?"

---

### Stage 3: Experimentation and Validation

**Goal**: Test assumptions and validate opportunities through rapid experimentation

**Important**: Test **one hypothesis at a time** with rapid experiments, focusing on maximum learning per dollar/time spent.

Ask: "Let's understand the Lean Startup approach:"

**Build-Measure-Learn Loop**:
- **Build**: Create minimum viable product (MVP)
- **Measure**: Test with customers, collect data
- **Learn**: Analyze results, validate or invalidate hypotheses
- **Pivot or Persevere**: Iterate based on learning

Goal: Maximize learning per dollar/time spent

Then: "What are the riskiest assumptions for your innovation?"

- What must be true for this to succeed?
- Customer need, willingness to pay, technical feasibility, etc.

Follow with: "Let's formulate testable hypotheses:"

**Format**: "We believe that [target customer] will [specific behavior] because [reason]."

**Example Hypotheses**:
- "We believe small business owners will pay $50/month for automated bookkeeping because they currently spend 10+ hours/week on it manually."
- "We believe patients will share health data through our app because they value coordinated care more than privacy concerns."

**Success Criteria**:
- Define what "success" looks like
- Quantitative metric: "30% of users complete onboarding"
- Qualitative: "8 out of 10 users say they'd recommend to colleague"

Ask: "Which MVP type will test your hypothesis with minimum effort?"

**MVP Types**:

**Concierge MVP**:
- Manually deliver service (not scalable, but informative)
- Example: Manually match customers before building algorithm

**Wizard of Oz MVP**:
- Fake the technology (humans behind the scenes)
- Example: "AI recommendation" that's actually human curators

**Landing Page MVP**:
- Describe product, gauge interest (signups, pre-orders)
- Test demand before building

**Prototype MVP**:
- Low-fidelity prototype (sketches, clickable mockup)
- Test usability and desirability

**Single-Feature MVP**:
- Build only core feature
- Example: Dropbox started with just file syncing (no sharing)

**Example - Food Delivery Service**:
- **Hypothesis**: "People will order healthy meal kits delivered weekly"
- **MVP**: Landing page describing service, collect email signups
- **Test**: If 200+ signups in first week, proceed to next test
- **Next MVP**: Manually deliver meals to 20 customers for one month
- **Test**: Retention rate, satisfaction, willingness to pay

Then: "Let's design your experiment:"

**Experimentation Process**:

**1. Define Hypothesis and Success Criteria**
- What are we testing?
- What would validate/invalidate hypothesis?

**2. Design Experiment**
- Minimum viable test
- Target sample size
- Timeline

**3. Build MVP**
- Focus on learning, not polish
- Timeboxed (1-4 weeks typical)

**4. Run Experiment**
- Recruit target users
- Observe, interview, measure

**5. Analyze Results**
- Did we reach success criteria?
- What did we learn?
- What surprises emerged?

**6. Decide: Pivot, Persevere, or Kill**
- **Persevere**: Hypothesis validated, continue developing
- **Pivot**: Hypothesis invalidated, change direction (new customer, feature, business model)
- **Kill**: No path forward, stop this initiative

Follow with: "If hypothesis is invalidated, which pivot type makes sense?"

**Pivot Types**:

**Customer Segment Pivot**:
- Different customer than expected finds value
- Example: B2B product becomes B2C

**Problem Pivot**:
- Product solves different problem than intended
- Example: Built collaboration tool, customers use it for project management

**Solution Pivot**:
- Same problem, different solution
- Example: Hardware → software

**Business Model Pivot**:
- Different revenue model
- Example: One-time purchase → subscription

**Channel Pivot**:
- Different distribution channel
- Example: Direct sales → partner channel

**Technology Pivot**:
- Different technology to achieve same solution
- Example: On-premise → cloud

**Stage 3 Output**: Present validated (or invalidated) hypotheses, MVP results, pivot-or-persevere decisions, and learning documentation. Ask: "Based on experiment results, will you persevere, pivot, or kill this initiative?"

---

### Stage 4: Development and Scale

## Usage Example

### Scenario: Retail Bank Pursuing Digital Innovation

**Stage 1: Strategy**

**Ambition**: Compete with digital-only banks, attract younger customers

**Portfolio**:
- H1 (70%): Improve mobile app, add features (mobile check deposit, budgeting tools)
- H2 (20%): Launch digital-only bank brand for millennials
- H3 (10%): Explore embedded finance (banking-as-a-service for partners)

**Stage 2: Discovery**

**Design Thinking Research**:
- Shadowed 20 millennials managing money
- **Insight**: They piece together 5+ apps (Venmo, Robinhood, Credit Karma, etc.) because traditional banks don't integrate investing, saving, and budgeting

**JTBD**: "When I get paid, I want to automatically save and invest based on my goals, so I can build wealth without thinking about it."

**Opportunity**: All-in-one money management app with automated saving/investing

**Stage 3: Experimentation**

**Hypothesis**: "Millennials will link bank account to auto-save/invest app and use it weekly"

**MVP**: Landing page describing app, email signup
**Result**: 2,000 signups in 2 weeks (exceeded 500 target)

**Next MVP**: Beta app with 100 users, automated savings only
**Result**: 70% weekly active, avg $200/month saved
**Learning**: High engagement, but users also want budgeting and investing in same app

**Decision**: Persevere, expand features

**Stage 4: Development**

**Stage-Gate**:
- **Gate 2**: Business case approved, $5M investment
- **Stage 3**: 6-month development, beta with 1,000 users
- **Gate 4**: Launch approved based on 80% satisfaction, 60% retention

**Launch**: New digital brand "SmartBank," marketed to 25-35 year-olds

**Stage 5: Results**

**6 months post-launch**:
- 50,000 customers (exceeded 30,000 target)
- 75% retention
- $50M in deposits
- NPS 65

**Learning**: Younger customers acquired, H2 innovation successful, considering H3 opportunity (license platform to other banks)

## Important Notes

### Innovation Best Practices

1. **Portfolio Balance**: Don't just do incremental (H1) or moonshots (H3)—balance across horizons
2. **Customer-Centric**: Ground innovations in real customer needs, not assumptions
3. **Fail Fast**: Test cheaply and quickly, kill bad ideas early
4. **Bias for Action**: Prototype and test > endless planning
5. **Learning Culture**: Reward learning from failure, not just success
6. **Disciplined Process**: Balance creativity with rigor (Stage-Gate or Lean)
7. **Long-Term Commitment**: Innovation takes time; don't give up after one failure

### Common Pitfalls

- **Innovation theater**: Lots of activity, no business impact
- **Lack of focus**: Too many small bets, none get resources to succeed
- **Idea graveyards**: Generate ideas but no process to develop them
- **Build without validation**: Skip customer testing, build what you think they want
- **Scaling too early**: Scale before product-market fit
- **Ignoring core business**: All resources to H3, neglect H1
- **Culture mismatch**: Innovation team separate, no connection to core business

### Success Factors

- Clear innovation strategy and objectives
- Senior leadership support and sponsorship
- Balanced portfolio (H1, H2, H3)
- Disciplined process (Stage-Gate, Lean Startup)
- Customer-centric discovery and validation
- Experimentation culture (safe to fail)
- Dedicated resources (budget, time, talent)
- Metrics tied to business outcomes
- Capability building (skills, tools, culture)
