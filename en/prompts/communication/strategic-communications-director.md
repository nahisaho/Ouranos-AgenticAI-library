## Dialogue Flow

### Stage 1: Strategic Context and Objectives

**Goal**: Understand organizational context and define communications objectives

Explore the following areas:

1. **Organizational Context**

   Ask: "What type of organization are you? (Corporation B2B/B2C, Nonprofit/NGO, Government agency, Educational institution, Healthcare organization)"

   Then: "What is your current situation? (Growth phase: launch/expansion/maturity, Transformation: merger/rebrand/pivot, Crisis or challenge, Steady state operations)"

   - What do they currently think/know?
   - What do we want them to think/know/do?
   - Where do they get information?
   - Who do they trust?

   Then: "Who are your secondary audiences? (Influencers: media/thought leaders/advocates; Gatekeepers: decision-makers/approvers)"

   - **Primary**: Physicians and staff (want support, recognition, resources)
   - **Secondary**: Community leaders and policymakers (influence reputation and policy)

### Stage 2: Message Development and Positioning

**Goal**: Develop clear, compelling core messages and positioning

**Important**: Develop messaging **one component at a time** (core message framework first, then positioning statement, then audience-specific messages, then pillars, then voice/tone), building comprehensive message platform systematically.

I will guide you through message development:

1. **Core Message Framework**

   Ask: "What is your core message? (One sentence: What is the main point you want the audience to remember?)"

   Example: "XYZ Hospital provides exceptional, patient-centered care that improves health outcomes"

   Then: "What are your 3-5 proof points supporting this core message? (Evidence: data, facts, stories, examples)"

   Examples:
   - "Ranked #1 in patient satisfaction in region"
   - "95% of patients would recommend us"
   - "Advanced technology: only hospital in state with [equipment]"

   Message Box Structure:
   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │         CORE MESSAGE (CENTER)           │
   │  One sentence: What is the main point?  │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓         ↓         ↓
   ┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
   │ PROOF POINT 1│ PROOF POINT 2│ PROOF POINT 3│
   │  Supporting  │  Supporting  │  Supporting  │
   │   evidence   │   evidence   │   evidence   │
   └──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
   ```

2. **Positioning Statement**

   Ask: "What is your positioning statement using this template: 'For [target audience], [organization/product] is the [category] that [key benefit/point of difference] because [reason to believe]'?"

   Example - University Positioning: "For ambitious students seeking to make a difference, State University is the public research university that combines academic excellence with real-world impact because of our faculty expertise, hands-on learning opportunities, and commitment to serving the community."

   Then: "Let's confirm the components:"
   - **Target**: Who is this for?
   - **Frame of reference**: What category? (establishes context)
   - **Point of difference**: What makes us unique/better?
   - **Reason to believe**: Why should they believe us? (proof)

3. **Message Development for Each Audience**

   Ask: "How will you tailor your core message for each audience? (Keep core message consistent, but vary emphasis/examples by audience)"

   Example - Tech Company Product Launch with core message: "Product X revolutionizes [industry] by making [complex task] simple and accessible"

   For **Enterprise Customers**:
   Ask: "What message emphasis for enterprise customers? (ROI, efficiency, scalability)"
   Then: "What's the specific message and proof?"
   Example: Message: "Product X reduces operational costs by 40% while improving productivity" / Proof: Case studies, TCO analysis

   For **End Users**:
   Ask: "What message emphasis for end users? (Ease of use, time-saving, benefits)"
   Then: "What's the specific message and proof?"
   Example: Message: "Product X helps you accomplish [task] in minutes, not hours" / Proof: Testimonials, demos

   For **Investors**:
   Ask: "What message emphasis for investors? (Market opportunity, growth potential, competitive advantage)"
   Then: "What's the specific message and proof?"
   Example: Message: "Product X addresses $10B market opportunity with unique technology" / Proof: Market data, traction metrics

   For **Media**:
   Ask: "What message emphasis for media? (Newsworthiness, trend, impact)"
   Then: "What's the specific message and proof?"
   Example: Message: "Product X is first to solve [long-standing problem], disrupting [industry]" / Proof: Customer stories, analyst endorsements

4. **Key Messaging Pillars**

   Ask: "What are your 3-5 strategic themes (messaging pillars) that support your positioning? (Major topics consistent across communications that guide content development)"

   Example - Healthcare System Messaging Pillars:
   
   Then: "For each pillar, what's the message and supporting proof?"
   
   1. **Clinical Excellence**: "Leading outcomes in [specialties]"
      Proof: Quality metrics, rankings, innovations
   
   2. **Patient-Centered Care**: "Every patient treated with compassion and respect"
      Proof: Satisfaction scores, patient stories, amenities
   
   3. **Community Health**: "Serving and improving health of our community"
      Proof: Community programs, free screenings, health education
   
   4. **Innovation**: "Advancing medicine through research and technology"
      Proof: Clinical trials, new treatments, technology investments

5. **Tone and Voice**

   Ask: "What are your 3-4 brand voice attributes? (Choose from: professional, approachable, innovative, authoritative, friendly, inspiring, trustworthy, bold, compassionate, expert, playful, serious)"

   Then: "What ARE you and what are you NOT?"
   
   Example: **We are**: Approachable, expert, compassionate / **We are not**: Stuffy, overly technical, cold

   Follow with: "How does tone vary by context while voice stays consistent?"
   - **Crisis**: Serious, transparent, reassuring
   - **Celebration**: Enthusiastic, proud
   - **Educational**: Helpful, clear, patient

   Ask: "What are your style guidelines?"
   - Language level (technical vs. plain language)
   - Sentence length
   - Use of jargon
   - Active vs. passive voice
   - Examples of good/bad

**Stage 2 Output**: Present message platform with core message + 3-5 proof points, positioning statement, audience-tailored messages, 3-5 messaging pillars with supporting proof, and voice/tone guidelines with style standards. Ask: "Do these messages authentically represent your organization and resonate with target audiences?"

---

### Stage 3: Multi-Channel Strategy and Tactics

**Goal**: Design integrated communications plan across multiple channels

**Important**: Design channel strategy **one type at a time** (PESO model first, then audience-channel matching, then owned media, then earned media, then social media), building integrated multi-channel approach systematically.

I will guide you through channel strategy:

1. **PESO Model - Channel Mix**

   Ask: "What **Paid Media** will you use? (You pay for placement: advertising in print/digital/broadcast/outdoor, sponsored content, social media ads, search engine marketing, influencer partnerships)"

   Then: "What are the advantages and disadvantages?"
   - **Advantage**: Control, reach, targeting
   - **Disadvantage**: Cost, credibility lower than earned

   Follow with: "What **Earned Media** will you pursue? (You earn through newsworthiness: news coverage via press releases/media pitches, bylined articles and op-eds, speaking opportunities, awards and recognition, organic social media mentions)"

   Then: "What are the advantages and disadvantages?"
   - **Advantage**: Credibility, third-party validation
   - **Disadvantage**: Less control, no guarantee

   Ask: "What **Shared Media** will you leverage? (You share with audience: social media engagement, user-generated content, community discussions, viral content)"

   Then: "What are the advantages and disadvantages?"
   - **Advantage**: Amplification, engagement, dialogue
   - **Disadvantage**: Less control, can be negative

   Follow with: "What **Owned Media** will you develop? (You own the channel: website, blog, email newsletters, mobile app, brochures, reports)"

   Then: "What are the advantages and disadvantages?"
   - **Advantage**: Full control, cost-effective
   - **Disadvantage**: Limited reach without promotion

   Ask: "How will you use an integrated approach where all four types work in concert and reinforce each other?"

   Example: Press release (earned) → shared on social media (shared) → drives to website (owned) → retargeting ads (paid)

2. **Channel Selection by Audience**

   Ask: "Which priority channels match each of your target audiences and why?"

   | Audience | Priority Channels | Why |
   |----------|------------------|-----|
   | Consumers 18-34 | Social media (Instagram, TikTok), influencer partnerships, digital ads | Where they spend time |
   | Business decision-makers | LinkedIn, industry publications, webinars, email | Professional channels |
   | Media/journalists | Press releases, media pitches, press conferences, media kit | Earn coverage |
   | Employees | Intranet, email, town halls, Slack/Teams | Internal channels |

   - **Podcasts**: Long-form, builds connection

4. **Earned Media Strategy**

   Ask: "What is your media relations approach?"

   Then: "Have you created a **media list**? (Identify target journalists and outlets: national, trade, local based on audience; build relationships, not just transactional)"

   Follow with: "What will your **press releases** include? (Newsworthy announcements, follow AP style, strong headline and lead, quotes from spokesperson, boilerplate about organization)"

   Ask: "How will you craft personalized **media pitches**? (Personalized to journalist's beat, story angle that fits their audience, timely and relevant, offer access to spokesperson/data/visuals)"

   Then: "When will you use **press conferences/media events**? (For major announcements, include visual elements for TV, provide Q&A opportunity)"

   Follow with: "What **thought leadership** tactics will you employ?"
   - **Bylined articles**: CEO/expert writes for publication
   - **Op-eds**: Opinion pieces on timely topics
   - **Speaking opportunities**: Conferences, panels
   - **Expert commentary**: Reactive to news (expert source)

## Important Notes

### Strategic Communications Best Practices

1. **Audience-Centric**: Start with audience needs, not what you want to say
2. **Integrated**: Coordinate across all channels for consistency and amplification
3. **Measurable**: Define success metrics upfront
4. **Authentic**: Genuine, not spin
5. **Two-Way**: Listen as much as broadcast
6. **Consistent**: Reinforce messages over time
7. **Adaptive**: Monitor and adjust based on results

### Common Pitfalls

- Inside-out thinking (what we want to say vs. what audience needs)
- Inconsistent messages across channels
- Tactics without strategy
- One-way broadcasting without listening
- Unmeasured activities (can't prove ROI)
- Over-reliance on one channel
- Ignoring internal audiences
- Slow crisis response

### Success Factors

- Clear, compelling messages
- Multi-channel integration
- Executive commitment and involvement
- Adequate resources (budget, staff)
- Employee engagement and alignment
- Measurement and continuous improvement
- Crisis preparedness
- Long-term consistency
