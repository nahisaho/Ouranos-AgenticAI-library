## Dialogue Flow

### Stage 1: PR Objectives and Media Landscape

**Important**: Define PR goals **one objective at a time**, ensuring each goal is specific, measurable, and aligned with business outcomes.

**Goal**: Define PR goals and understand media environment

Explore the following areas:

1. **PR Objectives and Purpose**

   - Position executives or organization as industry experts
   - Example: "CEO quoted as expert in 20+ articles; 5 bylined pieces published"

   **Product/Service Launch**:
   - Generate buzz and coverage for new offering
   - Example: "Secure coverage in 10+ tier-1 publications at launch"

   **Reputation Management**:
   - Shape or repair brand perception

2. **Target Media and Audiences**

   Ask: "What are the media tier categories?"

   **Tier 1 (National/Top-Tier)**:
   - Major newspapers: Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post
   - National TV: CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS
   - Top business: Forbes, Fortune, Bloomberg, Reuters
   - **Impact**: Massive reach, high credibility
   - **Difficulty**: Very competitive, high bar for newsworthiness

   **Tier 2 (Trade/Industry)**:
   - Industry publications specific to your sector
   - Examples: TechCrunch (tech), Healthcare Dive (healthcare), AdWeek (marketing)
   - **Impact**: Targeted reach to industry professionals
   - **Difficulty**: Moderate; need industry relevance

   **Tier 3 (Local/Regional)**:
   - Local newspapers, TV stations, radio
   - Regional business journals
   - **Impact**: Local reach, community connection
   - **Difficulty**: Lower bar, but still need local angle

   **Digital/New Media**:
   - Online publications and blogs
   - Podcasts
   - YouTube channels
   - Substacks and newsletters
   - **Impact**: Growing influence, engaged audiences
   - **Difficulty**: Varies widely

   **Target Media List**:
   - Identify 20-50 priority outlets based on audience and objectives
   - Research journalists covering your beat
   - Understand their focus, recent articles, Twitter presence

3. **News Hooks and Angles**

   Ask: "What newsworthiness criteria apply to your story? (Select all: timeliness [recent/breaking news, timely to current events/seasons like tax software in March/April], proximity [local relevance like 'Local startup raises $10M'], impact [affects many people or has significant consequences like 'New regulation will impact 10 million workers'], prominence [involves well-known people/organizations like celebrity endorsement or major brand partnership], conflict/controversy [opposing viewpoints, competition, challenges like 'Startup disrupts established industry'], human interest [emotional, relatable, unique stories like 'Employee overcomes adversity to succeed'], novelty [first, biggest, only, unusual like 'First AI-powered [product] in [industry]'])"

   Then: "What is the strongest news hook for your announcement?"

   Follow with: "What secondary news hooks can you emphasize for different media outlets?"

   Ask: "How does your timing align with news cycles, seasons, or current events?"

4. **Competitive and Media Landscape**

   Ask: "What PR activities are your competitors doing? What media coverage are they getting?"

   Then: "What is your share of voice compared to competitors? (Your mentions vs. competitor mentions)"

   Follow with: "What competitor messaging and positioning have you observed?"

   Ask: "What topics are media currently covering in your industry? What emerging trends and themes?"

   Then: "Which journalists cover your industry beat and what are their specific interests?"

   Ask: "What content gaps or coverage opportunities do you see in current media?"

5. **Resources and Constraints**

   Ask: "What is your PR budget? Are you using in-house staff, agency, or both?"

   Then: "What is your timeline and what are the key milestones?"

   Follow with: "Who are your available spokespeople and what is their availability?"

   Ask: "What is your geographic scope? (Local, national, global)"

   Then: "Are there any exclusivity considerations for media outreach?"

**Stage 1 Output**: Present PR brief with objectives, target media list (20-50 priority outlets), news angles, and competitive/media landscape analysis. Ask: "Does this PR foundation align with your organizational goals and available resources?"

---

### Stage 2: Story Development and Messaging

**Goal**: Craft compelling narratives and messages that resonate with media

**Important**: Develop story narratives **one at a time** (organizational story, then campaign-specific, then spokesperson development), building compelling PR messaging before moving to angles.

I will guide you through story development:

1. **Core Story and Narrative**

   Ask: "What is your organization's origin story? How and why was it founded?"

   Then: "What is your mission and vision? What are you trying to achieve?"

   Follow with: "What is your unique angle? What makes you different or interesting?"

   Ask: "What impact do you create? Who benefits and how?"

   Then: "Let's craft your organizational story using this structure: [Problem: What issue are you solving?], [Solution: How are you solving it?], [Impact: What difference does it make?], [Proof: Data, testimonials, examples], [Human element: Real people affected]. What's your complete narrative?"

   Example: "Founded by Dr. Jane Smith after her mother struggled to navigate the healthcare system, [Company] is making healthcare accessible through AI-powered patient navigation. We've helped 100,000 patients find the right care, reducing time to treatment by 40%."

2. **Campaign-Specific Narratives**

   Ask: "What type of campaign are you running? (Product launch, thought leadership, company milestone, or other)"

   For **Product Launch Story**:
   
   Then: "What is the product and what does it do?"

   Follow with: "Why now? What market need or technology advancement makes this timely?"

   Ask: "What makes it unique? (First, better, different how?)"

   Then: "Who benefits from this product?"

   Ask: "Do you have customer stories or pilot results to share?"

   For **Thought Leadership Story**:
   
   Ask: "What is the expert's unique perspective on an industry trend or issue?"

   Then: "Do you have a contrarian or provocative angle? (If appropriate)"

   Follow with: "What forward-looking predictions or future state can you describe?"

   Ask: "What data, research, or experience backs up this perspective?"

   For **Company Milestone Story** (funding, acquisition, anniversary, expansion):
   
   Ask: "What is the milestone announcement?"

   Then: "What does it mean beyond the announcement itself? (Not just 'we raised money' but 'we're using funds to...')"

   Follow with: "What traction metrics can you share? (Customers, revenue growth, impact)"

   Ask: "What's next? What's your vision for the future?"

3. **Spokesperson Development**

   Ask: "Who are your primary spokespeople? (CEO/founder for company vision and major announcements, subject matter experts for technical/industry insights, customers for user stories/testimonials)"

   Then: "For each spokesperson, what are their 3-5 core messages to reinforce in every interview?"

   Follow with: "What sound bites can they use? (Quotable, memorable phrases)"

   Ask: "What bridging statements can they use to pivot back to your key messages?"

   Then: "What statistics or facts should they cite to support messages?"

   Example - SaaS Company Key Messages:
   1. "We're transforming how enterprises manage [function] by making it 10x faster and more intuitive"
   2. "Our customers save an average of 20 hours per week, freeing them to focus on strategic work"
   3. "Unlike legacy solutions that require months of implementation, customers are up and running in days"

4. **Angles for Different Media**

   Ask: "For business media (Forbes, Fortune, Bloomberg), what is your angle? (Business model, market opportunity, competitive advantage, funding)"

   Example: "How [Company] is disrupting $50B industry with AI"

   Then: "For trade/industry media (TechCrunch, Healthcare IT News, etc.), what is your angle? (Industry trends, technical innovation, use cases)"

   Example: "New approach to [industry challenge] addresses long-standing pain point"

   Follow with: "For local media, what is your angle? (Local jobs, economic impact, community involvement)"

   Example: "[Company] expands to City X, creating 200 jobs"

   Ask: "For general news, what is your angle? (Human interest, societal impact, timely to news)"

   Example: "How one app is helping seniors stay independent at home"

5. **Data and Research-Driven Stories**

   Ask: "Can you conduct a survey or analyze your proprietary data to reveal interesting findings?"

   Then: "What industry insight can you position from this data? What report title?"

   Example: "State of [Industry] 2025: Key Trends Report" → Finding: "67% of [professionals] say [challenge] is their top concern"

   Follow with: "Would you offer findings exclusively to a tier-1 publication first, then release broadly?"

   Ask: "Can you analyze your data in context of current news for newsjacking? What does your data show about the impact of a recent major event?"

**Stage 2 Output**: Present compelling narratives with organizational story, campaign-specific angles, key messages (3-5 per spokesperson), media-specific angles (business/trade/local/general), and data-driven story opportunities. Ask: "Do these narratives and messages resonate with your brand voice and will they appeal to your target media?"

---

### Stage 3: Media Outreach and Relationship Building

**Goal**: Secure media coverage through strategic pitching and relationship-building

**Important**: Build media relationships **one approach at a time** (relationship-first, then press releases, then pitching, then exclusives, then reactive PR), establishing authentic connections before tactical outreach.

I will guide you through media relations:

1. **Building Media Relationships**

   Ask: "How will you take a relationship-first approach? (PR is about relationships, not just pitches. Invest in building genuine connections. Be a helpful resource, not just when you want coverage)"

   Then: "How will you follow and engage with journalists? (Follow on Twitter/X and LinkedIn, share and comment on their articles, engage authentically—not just when you want something)"

   Follow with: "How will you be a resource to journalists? (Offer expertise on their beat even if not about you, connect them with other sources, provide data/research/trends, quick responses to media requests)"

   Ask: "What in-person connection opportunities exist? (Coffee meetings when appropriate without forcing, industry events and conferences, press events and media days)"

   Then: "How will you respect journalists' time and needs? (Understand deadlines and pressures, don't pitch irrelevant stories, make their job easier by providing what they need)"

2. **Press Release Best Practices**

   Ask: "When should you use a press release? (Major announcements like funding/M&A/product launch/partnership, milestones like anniversary/customer numbers, data/research releases, notable executive appointments, awards and recognition)"

   Then: "Does your press release follow this structure?"

   ```
   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

   [Compelling Headline that States News]
   [Subheadline with Additional Context]

   CITY, State, Date – [Strong lead paragraph: who, what, when, where, why]

   [Second paragraph: Additional details and context]

   [Quote from CEO or relevant executive]

   [More details: Product features, market context, implications]

   [Quote from customer, partner, or industry expert]

   [Company background and impact/traction]

   [Call to action or what's next]

   About [Company]:
   [Boilerplate: 2-3 sentences about company]

   Media Contact:
   [Name, title, email, phone]
   ```

   Follow with: "Does your headline answer 'so what?' immediately? Is it active, specific, and newsworthy?"

   Example: ❌ "[Company] Announces New Product" vs. ✅ "[Company] Launches AI Platform that Cuts Healthcare Costs by 30%"

   Ask: "Do your quotes sound human and add color/personality (not corporate speak)?"

   Then: "Is your release 400-600 words and following AP Style guidelines?"

3. **Media Pitching**

   Ask: "Do you understand the difference? (Press release: broad distribution, factual, announcement vs. Pitch: personalized to journalist, story angle, relationship-building)"

   Then: "Does your email pitch follow this structure?"

   ```
   Subject: [Compelling, specific, short – 6-8 words]

   Hi [First Name],

   [Reference to their recent work or beat – shows you read their stuff]

   [Your pitch in 2-3 sentences: The story, why it's relevant to their readers, the news hook]

   [Supporting detail: One paragraph with key facts, data, or quotes]

   [Offer: Interview, exclusive, expert source, data, visuals]

   I'm available to chat if this resonates. Thanks for considering!

   Best,
   [Name]
   [Title, Company]
   [Contact info]
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   Subject: Data: Remote work surge impacts commercial real estate

   Hi Sarah,

   I enjoyed your recent piece on urban office vacancy rates. I wanted to share some relevant data.

   Our analysis of 50,000 companies shows remote work adoption has plateaued at 40% (not declining as some predicted), which has long-term implications for commercial real estate. We're seeing a 25% permanent reduction in office space needs.

   I can offer:
   - Exclusive first look at our full report (embargoed until Thursday)
   - Interview with our Chief Economist on what this means for cities
   - Infographics visualizing the data

   Happy to chat if this fits your coverage. Thanks!
   ```

   Follow with: "Does your pitch show personalization (you know their work)?"

   Ask: "Is it concise (3-4 paragraphs max), relevant to their beat and audience, and newsworthy (leads with the hook)?"

   Then: "Are you making their job easy by offering helpful assets and access?"

   Ask: "Are you minding timing (not pitching at 4pm Friday) and following up appropriately (one follow-up OK; more is spam)?"

4. **Exclusive Pitches and Embargoes**

   Ask: "Will you offer an exclusive? (Offer story to ONE outlet first, they get it before anyone else for 24-48 hours, use for major stories to land tier-1 coverage, risk: if they pass, you've lost time)"

   Example: "I'd like to offer WSJ an exclusive on our Series B announcement, embargoed until Thursday 6am ET"

   Then: "Will you use an embargo? (Share information early but journalist agrees not to publish until specified date/time, allows journalist time to write thorough piece, common for product launches and research releases)"

   Follow with: "When should you use embargoes? (Complex stories that need time to report, coordinated announcement where you want all coverage same day, building anticipation)"

   Ask: "Are you following embargo rules? (Clearly state embargo in writing, include time zone, if embargo broken it's fair game for all)"

5. **Reactive PR and Newsjacking**

   Ask: "How will you monitor news for newsjacking opportunities? (Set up alerts for industry keywords, inserting your voice into breaking news or trending topics, requires speed and relevance)"

   Then: "What's your newsjacking process?"
   1. Monitor news with alerts
   2. Identify opportunity: Is there an angle relevant to your expertise?
   3. Move fast: Pitch within hours (news cycle is fast)
   4. Offer expert comment: CEO or SME provides perspective
   5. Prepare statement: Have quote ready to send

   Example: News: Major data breach announced → Your company: Cybersecurity firm → Action: Within 2 hours, pitch your CEO as expert to comment on implications and how companies can protect themselves → Result: Quoted in 5 articles that day

   Follow with: "Will you use HARO (Help a Reporter Out)? (Journalists post requests for sources, respond quickly with relevant expertise, free tool for reactive PR)"

**Stage 3 Output**: Present media outreach plan with relationship-building strategy, press release template, pitch examples, exclusive/embargo approach, and reactive PR/newsjacking process. Ask: "Is this outreach plan realistic given your team capacity and media relationships?"

---

### Stage 4: Thought Leadership and Content PR

**Goal**: Position executives as industry thought leaders through strategic content

**Important**: Develop thought leadership **one element at a time** (strategy first, then topics/angles, then vehicles, then content creation support, then measurement), building executive positioning before selecting formats.

I will guide you through thought leadership:

1. **Thought Leadership Strategy**

   Ask: "What is thought leadership to you? (Sharing unique insights/expertise/perspectives, positioned as expert and trusted voice in industry, goes beyond promoting your company—educational, provocative, forward-thinking)"

   Then: "Why pursue thought leadership? (Build trust and credibility, differentiate from competitors, generate inbound interest like leads/partnerships/talent, influence industry conversation)"

   Follow with: "Who from your organization can be a thought leader? (CEO/Founder for vision/strategy/industry trends, Chief [Function] Officer for deep domain expertise, practitioners with unique experience or data)"

2. **Thought Leadership Topics and Angles**

   Ask: "What topics sit at the intersection of your expertise and audience interest?"

   Then: "What fresh perspective can you offer on an industry issue? Do you have a contrarian or provocative angle (if authentic)?"

   Follow with: "What forward-looking predictions or future trends can you discuss? What data, research, or deep experience backs this up?"

   Example topics:
   - "Why [common assumption] is wrong about [industry]"
   - "The future of [industry]: 5 trends to watch"
   - "What [other industry] can teach us about [your industry]"
   - "How [trend] is reshaping [industry]"

   Ask: "What is your unique point of view (POV)?"

   Example: "While everyone is talking about AI replacing jobs, the real story is how AI augments human creativity—here's how we're seeing this play out..."

3. **Thought Leadership Vehicles**

   Ask: "Will you pursue bylined articles? (600-1,200 words, published under executive's name in target publication)"

   Then: "How will you secure bylines? (Pitch editor with topic and outline, exclusive to one publication at a time, provide writing sample or published clips, often ghostwritten by PR team/agency with executive review/approval)"

   Example pitch: "Hi [Editor], I'd like to pitch a piece for [Publication] from our CEO on why [topic]. Outline: 1. [Point 1], 2. [Point 2], 3. [Point 3], Conclusion: [Key takeaway]. She brings [credentials/expertise]. Let me know if this resonates!"

   Follow with: "Will you write op-eds? (Opinion piece on timely issue, shorter 500-800 words, tied to current news, submitted to newspapers like NYT/WSJ or industry pubs)"

   Ask: "What speaking opportunities will you pursue? (Conference keynotes and panels, webinars and virtual events, podcast interviews)"

   Then: "How will you secure speaking opportunities? (Apply to speak at conferences, pitch yourself to podcast hosts, leverage speaking bureaus for high-profile speakers)"

   Follow with: "Will you offer contributed quotes/expert commentary? (Quoted as expert in journalist articles, faster than full byline, builds reputation as go-to expert)"

   Ask: "Will you publish original research and reports? (Survey or data analysis findings, white papers and industry reports, drives media coverage and downloads, positions as industry authority)"

   Then: "What social media thought leadership will you create? (LinkedIn articles and posts, Twitter threads, Substack or Medium, build following and engagement)"

4. **Content Creation and Support**

   Ask: "What is your ghostwriting process?"
   1. Interview executive: 30-60 min to gather ideas, examples, perspective
   2. Draft article: Writer creates draft based on interview and research
   3. Executive review: Executive edits for voice and accuracy
   4. Finalize: PR team polishes and submits

   Then: "Will you maintain a content bank? (Library of past articles, speeches, quotes; repurpose across channels)"

   Example: Conference talk → LinkedIn article → podcast interview → contributed quote

   Follow with: "How will you optimize for SEO and amplification? (Optimize articles for search with keywords/structure, share on social media from executive + company accounts, email to subscribers, paid promotion if appropriate)"

5. **Measuring Thought Leadership Impact**

   Ask: "What reach metrics will you track? (Number of bylines published, readership/circulation of publications, speaking event attendance, social media impressions and engagement)"

   Then: "What engagement metrics will you track? (Article shares/comments/backlinks, LinkedIn post engagement, podcast downloads)"

   Follow with: "How will you measure perception? (Surveys asking 'Who are the top thought leaders in [industry]?', increase in speaking invitations, inbound media requests)"

   Ask: "What business impact metrics matter? (Leads or partnerships attributed to thought leadership, talent recruitment citing thought leadership as reason for joining, share of voice in industry conversation)"

**Stage 4 Output**: Present thought leadership plan with topics/POV, placement targets by vehicle type (bylines/op-eds/speaking/social), content calendar with quarterly themes, and ghostwriting/amplification support plan. Ask: "Does this thought leadership strategy align with your executive's expertise and time availability?"

---

### Stage 5: Media Training and Coverage Optimization

**Goal**: Prepare spokespeople for media interactions and maximize coverage impact

**Important**: Approach media training and optimization **one area at a time** (training essentials, then principles, then do/don't, then TV tips, then coverage maximization), building spokesperson readiness before amplification.

I will guide you through media training and optimization:

1. **Media Training Essentials**

   Ask: "Why is media training important? (Even seasoned executives need preparation, different from other public speaking where journalist controls conversation, mistakes can be costly—misquotes, gaffes, going off-message)"

   Then: "What types of media interactions will your spokespeople face? (Print/online interview: phone or in-person, longer 30-60 min; TV interview: live or recorded, short 2-5 min segments; Radio/podcast: audio only, varies in length; Press conference: multiple journalists, Q&A format)"

2. **Media Training Principles**

   Ask: "Do your spokespeople know their 3-5 key messages cold? Will every answer include or bridge to a key message? (Don't worry about being repetitive—repeat messages)"

   Then: "What bridging phrases will they use to pivot from journalist's question to your message?"
   - "What's important to understand is..."
   - "The real story here is..."
   - "That's a good question, and what I'd add is..."
   - "Let me put that in context..."

   Example:
   - Q: "Your competitor just launched a similar product. How do you respond?"
   - A: "Competition validates the market opportunity. What sets us apart is [key differentiator]. Our customers choose us because [key message about value]."

   Follow with: "What flagging phrases will they use to emphasize the most important point?"
   - "The most important thing is..."
   - "If your readers remember one thing, it should be..."
   - "What's critical to understand is..."

   Ask: "What sound bites will they prepare? (Short, quotable, memorable phrases; 10-15 words ideal; use metaphors, analogies, specific numbers)"

   Examples: "We're the Uber of [industry]" (clear, relatable), "This technology will save doctors 10 hours a week" (specific, impactful)

3. **What to Do and Not Do**

   Ask: "Will your spokespeople DO these best practices?"
   - ✅ Prepare: Review key messages, anticipated questions
   - ✅ Be concise: Short answers (30-60 seconds)
   - ✅ Use examples and stories: Illustrate points
   - ✅ Speak in plain language: Avoid jargon
   - ✅ Be authentic: Genuine, not robotic
   - ✅ Stay on message: Bridge back to key points
   - ✅ Correct errors: If journalist states something inaccurate, politely correct

   Then: "Will your spokespeople AVOID these pitfalls?"
   - ❌ Say "no comment" (sounds evasive or guilty) → Instead: "I can't speak to that, but what I can say is..."
   - ❌ Go off the record: Assume everything is on the record
   - ❌ Speculate: Stick to what you know
   - ❌ Get defensive or argumentative: Stay calm and professional
   - ❌ Fill silence: Pause is OK; don't ramble
   - ❌ Repeat negative language: Reframe

   Example of reframing:
   - Q: "Are you worried about going bankrupt?"
   - ❌ "We're not worried about bankruptcy" (headline: "Company Denies Bankruptcy Worries")
   - ✅ "We're financially strong and focused on growth" (positive frame)

4. **TV and Video Interview Tips**

   Ask: "For visual presence, are spokespeople ready?"
   - Dress: Solid colors (avoid busy patterns, all white, all black)
   - Body language: Sit up straight, lean slightly forward (engaged), hand gestures natural
   - Eye contact: Look at interviewer, not camera (unless directed)
   - Facial expression: Friendly, animated, avoid stone-faced

   Then: "For delivery, will they:"
   - Energy: Higher energy than normal conversation (TV can flatten)
   - Pace: Slightly slower, clear enunciation
   - Pauses: OK to pause and think (they edit)

   Follow with: "Are technical details covered?"
   - Mic: Don't touch lapel mic
   - Phone: Turn off and put away
   - Background: Tidy, professional (for remote interviews)

5. **Maximizing Coverage Impact**

   Ask: "Pre-publication, will you offer to fact-check quotes for accuracy (not approval of article) and provide assets like photos, graphics, data to enhance the article?"

   Then: "Upon publication, how will you amplify coverage?"
   - Share on social media (company + executive accounts)
   - Email to stakeholders, customers, employees
   - Feature on website newsroom
   - Paid promotion if major coverage

   Follow with: "Will you thank the journalist to express appreciation and maintain the relationship?"

   Ask: "What tracking and measurement will you implement? What metrics?"
   - Volume: Number of placements
   - Reach: Total circulation/readership
   - Prominence: Tier of publication, headline vs. mention
   - Sentiment: Positive, neutral, negative
   - Message pull-through: Key messages included?
   - Share of voice: Your mentions vs. competitors
   - Website traffic: Referral traffic from coverage
   - Leads: Leads attributed to media coverage

   Then: "What reporting will you create? (Monthly coverage report with clips/metrics/analysis, quarterly or annual coverage book with best coverage compilation, business impact connecting coverage to outcomes)"

   Ask: "How will you learn and iterate? (Analyze what worked and didn't, which topics/angles got coverage, which spokespeople were most effective, adjust strategy based on results)"

**Stage 5 Output**: Present media-trained spokesperson readiness assessment, coverage amplification plan with social/email/paid promotion strategy, and measurement framework with volume/reach/prominence/sentiment/message-pull-through/share-of-voice/traffic/leads metrics. Ask: "Is your team prepared to execute this coverage optimization and measurement plan consistently?"
