## Dialogue Flow

### Stage 1: Review Scope and Purpose

**Goal**: Define the boundaries and goals of the literature review

**Important**: Explore scope **one area at a time** to ensure a clear, focused literature review foundation.

Explore the following areas:

1. **Purpose of Literature Review**

   Ask: "What is the purpose and type of your literature review?
   - What type of review are you conducting?
     - **Standalone systematic review**: Comprehensive, replicable review published as a paper
     - **Literature review chapter**: Part of thesis/dissertation, establishes foundation
     - **Background for research proposal**: Justify need for proposed study
     - **Narrative/traditional review**: Broader overview of a topic
   - What is the goal?
     - Synthesize what is known
     - Identify gaps
     - Develop theoretical framework
     - Support research questions/hypotheses
     - Inform practice or policy"

2. **Review Scope**

   Then: "What is the scope of your review?
   - What is your topic or research question?
   - Is the focus:
     - Broad (e.g., "teacher effectiveness") or narrow (e.g., "effects of peer coaching on novice teacher retention")?
     - Theoretical, methodological, empirical?
   - What time frame?
     - Recent (last 5-10 years) or comprehensive (all available)?
   - What types of sources?
     - Peer-reviewed journal articles only?
     - Include books, dissertations, grey literature, reports?
   - What disciplines or fields?
   - Any geographic or contextual limits?"

3. **Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria**

   Follow with: "What are your inclusion and exclusion criteria?
   - What will you include?
     - Publication type (empirical studies, theoretical, reviews)
     - Study design (quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods)
     - Population (e.g., K-12 teachers, higher education)
     - Language (English only, multiple languages)
     - Publication status (published only, or include unpublished)
   - What will you exclude?
     - Non-empirical (opinion pieces, editorials)
     - Poor quality
     - Irrelevant populations or contexts"

4. **Resources and Timeline**

   Ask: "What resources and timeline do you have available?
   - What databases do you have access to? (e.g., ERIC, PsycINFO, Web of Science)
   - What citation management software? (Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote)
   - How much time do you have?
   - Are you working alone or with a team?"

**Stage 1 Output**: Present your review scope document with research question, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and search parameters. Ask: "Does this scope clearly define the boundaries and goals of your literature review?"

---

### Stage 2: Search Strategy and Source Identification

**Goal**: Develop comprehensive, systematic search to identify relevant literature

**Important**: Develop search strategy **one component at a time** to ensure comprehensive identification of relevant literature.

I will guide you through search strategy development:

1. **Developing Search Terms**

   Ask: "What search terms will you use?

   **PICO Framework** (for focused questions):
   - **P**opulation: Who?
   - **I**ntervention/Exposure: What?
   - **C**omparison: Compared to what?
   - **O**utcome: What result?

   **Example**:
   - **P**: Novice teachers
   - **I**: Mentoring programs
   - **C**: No mentoring
   - **O**: Retention rates

   **Building Search Strings**:

   **Step 1: Identify Key Concepts**:
   - Concept 1: Novice teachers
   - Concept 2: Mentoring
   - Concept 3: Retention

   **Step 2: List Synonyms and Related Terms**:
   - Novice teachers: "beginning teacher*", "new teacher*", "early career teacher*", "first year teacher*"
   - Mentoring: mentor*, coach*, induction, "professional support"
   - Retention: retention, turnover, attrition, "job satisfaction", "staying in teaching"

   **Step 3: Combine with Boolean Operators**:
   - **OR** (within concept): novice OR beginning OR new (broader search)
   - **AND** (between concepts): teachers AND mentoring AND retention (narrower search)
   - **NOT** (exclude): teachers NOT "student teachers"

   **Step 4: Use Wildcards and Phrase Searching**:
   - **Wildcard (*)**: mentor* finds mentor, mentoring, mentors
   - **Quotation marks**: "beginning teacher" finds exact phrase

   **Final Search String Example**:
   ```
   ("beginning teacher*" OR "new teacher*" OR "novice teacher*" OR "early career teacher*")
   AND
   (mentor* OR coach* OR induction OR "professional support")
   AND
   (retention OR turnover OR attrition OR "job satisfaction")
   ```"

2. **Database Selection**

   Then: "Which databases will you search?

   **Education**:
   - **ERIC** (Education Resources Information Center): Education research
   - **Education Source**: EBSCO education database

   **Psychology**:
   - **PsycINFO**: Psychology and related fields
   - **PsycARTICLES**: Full-text psychology journals

   **Multidisciplinary**:
   - **Web of Science**: Broad, citation tracking
   - **Scopus**: Broad, abstracts and citations
   - **Google Scholar**: Very broad, includes grey literature (supplement, not primary)

   **Health/Medical**:
   - **PubMed/MEDLINE**: Medicine and health
   - **CINAHL**: Nursing and allied health

   **Business**:
   - **Business Source Premier**: Business and management

   **Choose Based On**:
   - Your topic and field
   - Comprehensiveness needed
   - Database access"

3. **Conducting the Search**

   Follow with: "How will you conduct and document the search?

   **Systematic Search Process**:

   **Step 1: Pilot Search**:
   - Test search string in one database
   - Too many results? Add terms with AND, make more specific
   - Too few results? Remove terms, use more OR, use wildcards

   **Step 2: Refine Search**:
   - Adjust based on pilot
   - Ensure balance: comprehensive but manageable

   **Step 3: Execute Search in All Databases**:
   - Run same (or adapted) search in each database
   - Document: Date, database, search string, # of results
   - Export results to citation manager

   **Step 4: Additional Strategies**:
   - **Citation chaining**: Check references of key articles (backward)
   - **Cited by search**: Who has cited key articles? (forward)
   - **Hand searching**: Key journals
   - **Grey literature**: Dissertations (ProQuest), conference proceedings, reports"

4. **Citation Management**

   Ask: "What citation management system will you use?

   **Popular Tools**:
   - **Zotero** (free, open-source, user-friendly)
   - **Mendeley** (free, owned by Elsevier)
   - **EndNote** (paid, powerful)

   **What Citation Managers Do**:
   - Import citations from databases
   - Organize into folders/collections
   - Attach PDFs
   - Remove duplicates
   - Insert citations in Word/Google Docs
   - Generate bibliographies in any style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)

   **Workflow**:
   1. Export search results from database to citation manager
   2. Import into citation manager
   3. Remove duplicates
   4. Organize into folders (e.g., "To Screen", "Included", "Excluded")
   5. Attach PDFs
   6. Read and annotate
   7. Cite while writing"

5. **PRISMA Flow Diagram** (for systematic reviews)

   Then: "How will you document the search and screening process?

   **PRISMA**: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses

   **Flow Diagram Shows**:
   - Records identified through database searching
   - Additional records from other sources
   - Records after duplicates removed
   - Records screened (title/abstract)
   - Records excluded
   - Full-text articles assessed for eligibility
   - Full-text articles excluded (with reasons)
   - Studies included in synthesis

   **Example**:
   ```
   Identification:
   - Database search: 1,250 records
   - Other sources: 15 records
   - Total: 1,265 records

   Screening:
   - After duplicates removed: 950 records
   - Screened (title/abstract): 950 records
   - Excluded: 820 records (not relevant)
   - Full-text assessed: 130 articles

   Eligibility:
   - Excluded: 85 articles
     - Wrong population: 30
     - No relevant outcome: 25
     - Not empirical: 20
     - Poor quality: 10

   Included:
   - Studies in review: 45 articles
   ```"

**Stage 2 Output**: Present your search strategy documentation with search strings, database list, and PRISMA diagram (if applicable). Ask: "Is this search strategy comprehensive and replicable?"

---

### Stage 3: Critical Appraisal and Quality Assessment

**Goal**: Evaluate the quality and relevance of identified sources

**Important**: Appraise sources **one step at a time** to ensure rigorous quality assessment and selection.

I will guide you through critical appraisal:

1. **Screening Process**

   Ask: "How will you screen the identified sources?

   **Two-Stage Screening**:

   **Stage 1: Title and Abstract Screening**:
   - Quickly review title and abstract
   - Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria
   - Exclude clearly irrelevant
   - When in doubt, include (review full text)
   - **Outcome**: Narrowed list for full-text review

   **Stage 2: Full-Text Screening**:
   - Retrieve and read full text
   - Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria more rigorously
   - Document reasons for exclusion
   - **Outcome**: Final set of included studies

   **Inter-Rater Reliability** (for systematic reviews):
   - Two reviewers independently screen same sample (e.g., 10%)
   - Calculate agreement (Cohen's kappa)
   - Discuss disagreements, refine criteria
   - Ensures consistency"

2. **Critical Appraisal Questions**

   Then: "What critical appraisal questions will you apply?

   **For All Sources**:
   - Is the research question clear?
   - Is the methodology appropriate for the question?
   - Is the sample adequate?
   - Are results clearly presented?
   - Are conclusions supported by data?
   - Are limitations acknowledged?
   - Is the work credible and trustworthy?

   **For Quantitative Studies**:
   - Is the research design appropriate (experimental, correlational, etc.)?
   - Is the sample size adequate (power analysis)?
   - Are measures valid and reliable?
   - Are statistical analyses appropriate?
   - Are effect sizes reported?
   - Are confounding variables controlled?

   **For Qualitative Studies**:
   - Is the approach appropriate (phenomenology, grounded theory, etc.)?
   - Is sampling strategy appropriate (purposeful)?
   - Is data collection rigorous (interview protocols, observations)?
   - Is analysis systematic (coding, themes)?
   - Is trustworthiness addressed (credibility, transferability)?
   - Are researcher biases acknowledged (reflexivity)?

   **For Reviews**:
   - Is the search comprehensive and systematic?
   - Are inclusion/exclusion criteria clear?
   - Is quality appraisal conducted?
   - Is synthesis method appropriate?"

3. **Quality Assessment Tools**

   Follow with: "What quality assessment tools will you use?

   **Quantitative**:

   **RCTs (Randomized Controlled Trials)**:
   - **Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool**: Assesses selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting bias

   **Non-RCTs**:
   - **Newcastle-Ottawa Scale**: Quality of non-randomized studies
   - **ROBINS-I**: Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies

   **Qualitative**:

   **CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme)**:
   - 10 questions assessing rigor
   - Clear aims, appropriate methodology, trustworthy results?

   **COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research)**:
   - 32-item checklist

   **Mixed Methods**:

   **MMAT (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool)**:
   - Assesses quality of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies

   **Quality Rating**:
   - High quality: Low risk of bias, rigorous methods
   - Moderate quality: Some concerns
   - Low quality: High risk of bias, methodological flaws
   - **Decision**: Exclude low quality or note in synthesis"

4. **Data Extraction**

   Ask: "What data will you extract from each source?

   **What to Extract**:
   - Citation (author, year, title, journal)
   - Study characteristics (design, sample, setting)
   - Methods (data collection, analysis)
   - Results/findings
   - Quality rating
   - Relevant quotes or specific data

   **Data Extraction Form Template**:

   ```markdown

   - Systematic review software (Covidence, DistillerSR)"

**Stage 3 Output**: Present your quality-appraised set of sources with data extraction forms. Ask: "Have you rigorously assessed quality and extracted relevant data from all included sources?"

---

### Stage 4: Synthesis and Organization

**Goal**: Synthesize findings into coherent narrative or analysis

**Important**: Synthesize findings **one approach at a time** to ensure coherent organization and analysis.

I will guide you through synthesis approaches:

1. **Types of Synthesis**

   Ask: "What type of synthesis will you conduct?

   **Narrative Synthesis**:
   - Describe and interpret findings in words
   - Group by themes, theoretical framework, methodology, chronology
   - Most common for traditional reviews
   - **When**: Studies too diverse for meta-analysis, qualitative studies

   **Thematic Synthesis**:
   - Identify recurring themes across studies
   - Similar to qualitative thematic analysis
   - **When**: Qualitative or mixed studies, exploring experiences or processes

   **Meta-Analysis**:
   - Quantitative synthesis using statistical techniques
   - Combine effect sizes across studies
   - Requires: Similar quantitative outcomes, adequate data
   - **When**: Multiple quantitative studies with comparable measures
   - **Example**: Combine effect sizes of mentoring on teacher retention across 20 studies

   **Meta-Synthesis**:
   - Synthesis of qualitative findings
   - Interpretive, generates new insights
   - **When**: Multiple qualitative studies on similar phenomena"

2. **Organizing the Literature**

   Then: "How will you organize the literature?

   **Common Organizational Structures**:

   **By Theme**:
   - Group studies by key themes or concepts
   - **Example**:
     - Theme 1: Benefits of Mentoring
     - Theme 2: Challenges of Mentoring
     - Theme 3: Characteristics of Effective Mentoring

   **By Theoretical Framework**:
   - Organize by competing theories or perspectives
   - **Example**:
     - Cognitive Theories
     - Sociocultural Theories
     - Behavioral Theories

   **By Methodology**:
   - Separate quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods
   - Compare/contrast findings

   **Chronologically**:
   - Trace development of research over time
   - Show evolution of ideas

   **By Variables or Concepts**:
   - Organize around key variables in your model
   - **Example**: Independent variables → Moderators → Dependent variables"

3. **Synthesizing Findings**

   Follow with: "How will you synthesize the findings?

   **Narrative Synthesis Process**:

   **Step 1: Develop Preliminary Synthesis**:
   - Group studies by similarity
   - Identify patterns
   - Note consistent findings vs. contradictions

   **Step 2: Explore Relationships**:
   - What do studies agree on?
   - Where do they differ? Why? (different methods, populations, contexts)
   - Are there gaps?

   **Step 3: Assess Robustness**:
   - Are findings based on high-quality studies?
   - How consistent are findings across studies?

   **Example Synthesis - Mentoring and Teacher Retention**:

   ```markdown
   ## Theme: Impact of Mentoring on Retention

   A substantial body of research demonstrates that mentoring programs 
   are associated with higher teacher retention rates. In a meta-analysis 
   of 15 studies, Ingersoll and Strong (2011) found that teachers who 
   received mentoring were 1.5 times more likely to remain in teaching 
   after three years (OR = 1.5, 95% CI [1.2, 1.8]). This finding is 
   supported by multiple large-scale studies (Smith, 2015; Jones et al., 
   2018) and qualitative research highlighting that mentoring provides 
   emotional support and practical guidance critical for novice teacher 
   success (Brown, 2017; Davis, 2019).

   However, not all mentoring programs are equally effective. Studies 
   consistently find that the quality of the mentor-mentee relationship 
   matters more than the mere presence of a mentor (Lee & Chen, 2020). 
   Factors associated with effective mentoring include regular meetings 
   (at least weekly), subject-matter match between mentor and mentee, 
   and structured programs with clear goals (Thompson, 2016; Williams 
   et al., 2021).
   ```"

4. **Evidence Tables and Summary Matrices**

   Ask: "How will you organize the evidence visually?

   **Summary Table of Studies**:

   | Author (Year) | Design | Sample | Key Findings | Quality |
   |---------------|--------|--------|--------------|---------|
   | Smith (2015) | Quasi-exp | n=300 teachers | Mentoring → 20% higher retention | High |
   | Jones et al. (2018) | Longitudinal | n=1,200 teachers | Quality of relationship matters | High |
   | Brown (2017) | Qualitative | n=20 teachers | Emotional support key theme | Medium |

   **Thematic Matrix**:

   | Theme | Supporting Studies | Key Findings |
   |-------|-------------------|--------------|
   | Emotional Support | Brown (2017), Davis (2019) | Reduces isolation, builds confidence |
   | Practical Guidance | Smith (2015), Lee & Chen (2020) | Classroom management, lesson planning |
   | Relationship Quality | Jones et al. (2018), Williams et al. (2021) | Trust, frequency, subject match |"

5. **Identifying Gaps**

   Then: "What gaps in the literature have you identified?

   **Types of Gaps**:

   **Knowledge Gaps**:
   - Topics not studied
   - Unanswered questions
   - **Example**: "While much research examines mentoring in K-12, little is known about mentoring in early childhood education."

   **Methodological Gaps**:
   - Need for different methods
   - **Example**: "Most studies are correlational; experimental studies are needed to establish causality."

   **Population or Context Gaps**:
   - Understudied groups or settings
   - **Example**: "Research has focused on urban and suburban schools; rural schools are understudied."

   **Theoretical Gaps**:
   - Lack of theoretical grounding
   - **Example**: "Few studies apply social capital theory to understand mentoring relationships."

   **Practical Gaps**:
   - Research hasn't informed practice
   - **Example**: "Despite evidence for mentoring, many schools lack structured programs.""

**Stage 4 Output**: Present your synthesized literature with themes, evidence tables, and identified gaps. Ask: "Does this synthesis effectively organize findings, identify patterns, and highlight knowledge gaps?"

---

### Stage 5: Writing the Literature Review

**Goal**: Write clear, well-organized, critical literature review

**Important**: Write the review **one section at a time** to ensure clarity, critical analysis, and coherent argumentation.

I will guide you through writing:

1. **Literature Review Structure**

   Ask: "What will be the structure of your literature review?

   **Introduction**:
   - Purpose of the review
   - Scope and boundaries
   - Importance of topic
   - Organization of review

   **Body** (organized by themes, theories, chronology, etc.):
   - Theme/Section 1
     - Synthesis of research
     - Critical analysis
     - Comparison of findings
   - Theme/Section 2
     - ...
   - Theme/Section 3
     - ...

   **Conclusion/Summary**:
   - Key findings synthesized
   - Gaps in literature
   - Implications for your research (if part of larger study)
   - Future research directions

   **Example Outline**:
   ```
   I. Introduction
      A. Teacher retention crisis
      B. Purpose: Synthesize research on mentoring and retention
      C. Organization preview

   II. Theoretical Framework
      A. Social capital theory
      B. Communities of practice

   III. Impact of Mentoring on Retention
      A. Quantitative evidence
      B. Qualitative insights
      C. Synthesis: Strong positive relationship

   IV. Characteristics of Effective Mentoring
      A. Mentor-mentee relationship quality
      B. Program structure
      C. Contextual factors

   V. Gaps and Future Directions
      A. Need for experimental studies
      B. Understudied populations
      C. Long-term impact

   VI. Conclusion
      A. Summary of key findings
      B. Implications for practice and research
   ```"

2. **Writing Strategies**

   Then: "What writing strategies will you use for effective synthesis?

   **Critical, Not Just Descriptive**:

   **Descriptive** (weaker):
   - "Smith (2015) found that mentoring improves retention. Jones (2018) also found that mentoring helps retention. Brown (2017) interviewed teachers and found that mentoring is helpful."

   **Critical** (stronger):
   - "Converging evidence from quantitative (Smith, 2015; Jones, 2018) and qualitative (Brown, 2017) research demonstrates that mentoring is associated with higher retention. However, the strength of this relationship appears moderated by the quality of the mentoring relationship (Jones, 2018), suggesting that simply assigning a mentor is insufficient."

   **Synthesize, Don't Summarize**:
   - Don't: Describe each study separately (Study 1 found X. Study 2 found Y.)
   - Do: Group studies by theme and synthesize (Multiple studies found X [cite, cite, cite]. However, some studies found Y [cite, cite].)

   **Use Your Voice**:
   - You are guiding the reader through the literature
   - Make arguments about what research shows
   - Critically evaluate strengths and weaknesses

   **Show Connections**:
   - "Building on Smith's (2015) findings, Jones (2018) examined..."
   - "In contrast to earlier work (Brown, 2010), recent studies suggest...""

3. **Citation and Paraphrasing**

   Follow with: "How will you cite and paraphrase sources?

   **When to Cite**:
   - Direct quotes (use sparingly)
   - Paraphrased ideas from specific source
   - Statistics or specific findings
   - When you make a claim based on literature

   **Paraphrasing** (most common):
   - Read the original
   - Put it in your own words
   - Cite the source

   **Example**:
   - **Original**: "Mentoring programs that included regular, structured meetings and subject-specific guidance were associated with retention rates 25% higher than programs without these features" (Smith, 2015, p. 42).
   - **Paraphrase**: Teachers participating in structured mentoring programs with frequent meetings and content-area support showed substantially higher retention compared to less structured programs (Smith, 2015).

   **Direct Quote** (use when exact wording matters):
   - Use quotation marks
   - Include page number
   - **Example**: As Smith (2015) argued, "The mentor-mentee relationship is the single most important factor in program success" (p. 45).

   **Citation Styles**:
   - **APA** (social sciences): (Smith, 2015) or Smith (2015) found...
   - **MLA** (humanities): (Smith 45) or Smith argues...
   - **Chicago** (history): Footnotes/endnotes"

4. **Avoiding Common Pitfalls**

   Ask: "How will you avoid common literature review pitfalls?

   **Lack of Organization**:
   - Solution: Create detailed outline before writing

   **Too Descriptive**:
   - Solution: Synthesize across studies, make arguments

   **No Critical Analysis**:
   - Solution: Evaluate quality, compare findings, identify contradictions

   **Cherry-Picking**:
   - Solution: Include all relevant studies, note contradictory findings

   **Plagiarism**:
   - Solution: Always cite, paraphrase in own words, use quotes for exact wording

   **Too Many Quotes**:
   - Solution: Paraphrase most content, quote sparingly"

5. **Final Checklist**

   Then: "Have you completed all quality checks before submission?

   Before submitting:

   - [ ] All sources meet inclusion criteria
   - [ ] Search process documented (for systematic review)
   - [ ] Quality appraisal conducted
   - [ ] Literature organized thematically/logically
   - [ ] Synthesis, not just summary

## Important Notes

### Literature Review Best Practices

1. **Be Systematic**: Document search, use explicit criteria
2. **Be Comprehensive**: Multiple databases, citation chaining
3. **Be Critical**: Evaluate quality, don't accept all claims
4. **Synthesize**: Group and compare, not study-by-study summary
5. **Identify Gaps**: Show what's missing to justify your research
6. **Cite Accurately**: Every claim needs a source
7. **Stay Organized**: Use citation manager, keep notes

### Common Pitfalls

- Unsystematic search (missing key studies)
- Including low-quality or irrelevant studies
- Purely descriptive (no synthesis or critique)
- Plagiarism or inadequate paraphrasing
- Too many quotes
- Poor organization
- No identified gaps

### Success Factors

- Clear, focused research question
- Comprehensive, documented search
- Critical appraisal of sources
- Thematic organization
- Synthesis across studies
- Critical voice and argumentation
- Clear identification of gaps
- Excellent writing and citation
