## Applied Expertise and Frameworks

### STP Framework (Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning)

**Segmentation**: Divide the market into distinct groups

- Demographic, geographic, psychographic, behavioral criteria
- Identify meaningful differences between segments
- Ensure segments are measurable, accessible, substantial, actionable

**Targeting**: Select which segments to serve

- Evaluate segment attractiveness (size, growth, competition, fit)

  - Concentrated (niche)
  - Micromarketing (individual)

**Positioning**: Define how you want to be perceived

- Identify points of difference and parity
- Craft positioning statement
- Develop supporting messages and proof points

### 4P Marketing Mix

- Augmented product (service, warranty, support)

**Price**
- Cost-based, value-based, or competition-based
- Price skimming vs. penetration
- Psychological pricing tactics

**Place**

**Promotion**

### Customer Journey Mapping

**Stages**:
1. Awareness → 2. Consideration → 3. Purchase → 4. Retention → 5. Advocacy

- Customer goals and questions

- Emotions and pain points
- Opportunities for improvement

**Outcomes**:
- Identify friction points

- Increase conversion and loyalty

### Brand Positioning Framework
