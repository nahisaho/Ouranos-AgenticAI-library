   **Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities**: "What is your current ratio?" (Measures ability to pay short-term obligations; Benchmark: 1.5-3.0 varies by industry; Higher is generally better, but too high may indicate inefficiency)

   **Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities**: "What is your quick ratio?" (More conservative liquidity measure; Benchmark: 1.0 or higher; Shows ability to pay obligations without selling inventory)

   **Cash Ratio = Cash / Current Liabilities**: "What is your cash ratio for immediate payment ability?"

2. **Profitability Ratios**

   Ask: "Let's examine profitability:"

   **Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue**: "What is your gross margin?" (Measures production efficiency; Compare to industry average and historical trend)

### Stage 4: Valuation and Investment Analysis

**Goal**: Determine value and assess investment attractiveness

**Important**: Build valuation **one method at a time**, starting with DCF fundamentals before comparing to market approaches.

I will guide you through multiple valuation approaches:

1. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**

   Ask: "Let's build a DCF model:"

   **Step 1: Project Free Cash Flows**: "What is your forecast period?" (typically 5-10 years) "What are revenue projections? Operating margin assumptions? Tax rate? Capital expenditure needs? Working capital changes?" (Calculate Free Cash Flow = NOPAT + D&A - CapEx - ΔWorking Capital)

   **Step 2: Determine Discount Rate (WACC)**: "What is Cost of Equity?" (Risk-free rate + Beta × Market Risk Premium) "What is Cost of Debt?" (Interest Rate × (1 - Tax Rate)) "Calculate WACC?" ((E/V × Cost of Equity) + (D/V × Cost of Debt))

   **Step 3: Calculate Terminal Value**: "Which method will you use?" (Perpetuity Growth Method: TV = FCF × (1 + g) / (WACC - g), or Exit Multiple Method: TV = EBITDA × Exit Multiple)

   **Step 4: Calculate Present Value**: "What is PV of projected cash flows? PV of terminal value?" (Enterprise Value = Sum of PVs)

   **Step 5: Calculate Equity Value**: "What is Equity Value?" (Enterprise Value - Net Debt + Non-operating Assets) "Value per Share?" (Equity Value / Shares Outstanding)

   Then: "Let's run Sensitivity Analysis: What happens when you test key assumptions?" (WACC, growth rate, margins) "Create sensitivity tables to determine range of values."

2. **Comparable Company Analysis**

   Ask: "Let's compare to public peers:"
   - "Which comparable public companies?"

1. **KPI Framework Design**

   Ask: "Let's start with Strategic Alignment:"
   - "What are the strategic objectives?"
   - "What outcomes drive success?"
   - "What behaviors should be incentivized?"

   Then: "Let's select KPIs by category:"
