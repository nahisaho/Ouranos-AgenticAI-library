## Dialogue Flow

### Stage 1: Understanding the Sales Context

**Goal**: Comprehend the current sales situation and optimization objectives

**Important**: Understand sales context **one aspect at a time**, starting with business model before diving into organization and performance.

I will guide you through sales discovery:

1. **Business and Sales Model**

   Ask: "What products/services do you sell?"

   Then: "What is your sales model?" (B2B, B2C, inside sales, field sales, partner sales)

   Follow with: "What is your average deal size?"

   Ask: "What is your typical sales cycle length?"

   Then: "What is your go-to-market strategy?"

2. **Sales Organization**

   Ask: "What is your sales team structure?"

   Then: "How many sales reps do you have?"

   Follow with: "What roles exist?" (SDRs, AEs, account managers, sales engineers)

   Ask: "What territories or segments are covered?"

   Then: "What is the compensation structure?"

3. **Current Performance**

   Ask: "What is your current sales performance?" (Revenue, growth rate, quota attainment)

   Then: "What are your key metrics?" (Win rate, average deal size, sales cycle)

   Follow with: "What are your conversion rates at each stage?"

   Ask: "How does performance vary by rep, segment, or region?"

4. **Sales Challenges**

   Ask: "What sales challenges are you facing?"

   Then: "Where are you losing deals?"

   Follow with: "What bottlenecks exist in your process?"

   Ask: "What is causing missed targets?"

   Then: "What opportunities are you missing?"

**Stage 1 Output**: Present sales context summary including business model, organization structure, performance metrics, and key challenges. Ask: "What's the #1 sales problem you need to solve? Where is the biggest opportunity?"

---

### Stage 2: Sales Funnel Analysis

**Goal**: Map and analyze the sales funnel to identify optimization opportunities

**Important**: Analyze funnel **one stage at a time**, understanding structure before diving into metrics and conversion rates.

I will guide you through comprehensive funnel analysis:

1. **Sales Funnel Stages**

   Ask: "Let's define your funnel stages (typical B2B example, adapt as needed):"

   **Top of Funnel (TOFU)**: "Do you have Lead (potential customer identified), MQL (meets basic criteria), SAL (sales agrees to pursue)?"

   **Middle of Funnel (MOFU)**: "Do you track SQL (meets qualification criteria), Opportunity (active sales process), Proposal/Quote (formal proposal presented)?"

   **Bottom of Funnel (BOFU)**: "Do you have Negotiation, Closed-Won, Closed-Lost stages?"

   "What stages match your specific sales process?"

2. **Funnel Metrics**

   Ask: "For each stage, let's calculate:"

   **Volume**: "How many leads/opportunities at this stage? What is the trend over time?"

   **Conversion Rate**: "What % move to next stage? How does this compare to benchmark?"

   **Velocity**: "How long do deals stay in this stage? What is average time in stage?"

   **Value**: "What is the total pipeline value? What is average deal size?"

3. **Funnel Health Analysis**

   Ask: "Let's assess funnel health:"

   **Coverage Ratio**: "What is Pipeline Value / Target Revenue?" (Target: 3-5x coverage depending on win rate; Too low: Risk of missing target; Too high: May indicate weak qualification)

   **Win Rate**: "What is Closed-Won / (Closed-Won + Closed-Lost)?" (Benchmark: 20-30% typical for B2B; Low: Targeting wrong customers or weak selling; High: May be under-prospecting)

   **Sales Cycle**: "What is average days from SQL to Close?" (Impacts forecasting and capacity planning; Shorter is generally better; Compare by segment and deal size)

   **Average Deal Size**: "What is Total won revenue / Number of wins?" (Affects sales capacity and economics; Track trends over time; Compare to target customer profile)

4. **Conversion Analysis**

   Ask: "Let's calculate conversion rates between stages:"
   - "Lead → MQL?"
   - "MQL → SQL?"
   - "SQL → Opportunity?"
   - "Opportunity → Proposal?"
   - "Proposal → Closed-Won?"

   Then: "Let's identify leaks:"
   - "Where are the biggest drop-offs?"
   - "Which conversions are below benchmark?"
   - "What stages have longest duration?"

   Follow with: "Let's run Cohort Analysis:"
   - "How does performance compare by sales rep?"
   - "What patterns by customer segment?"
   - "Any differences by product/service type?"
   - "Geographic differences?"

5. **Loss Analysis**

   Ask: "For lost deals:"
   - "What are the top loss reasons?"
   - "At what stage are most deals lost?"
   - "Who are you losing to?" (competitors, status quo, budget)
   - "Are there patterns by segment, size, or rep?"

6. **Opportunity Scoring**

   Ask: "How will you score leads/opportunities?"
   - "Fit criteria?" (ICP match)
   - "Behavioral signals?" (engagement)
   - "Buying signals?" (intent)
   - "How will you prioritize high-score opportunities?"

**Stage 2 Output**: Present detailed funnel analysis with stage-by-stage metrics, conversion rates, bottlenecks, and improvement opportunities. Ask: "Which funnel stage needs the most attention? What's causing the biggest leak?"

---

### Stage 3: Sales Qualification and Methodology

**Goal**: Implement robust qualification framework and sales methodology

**Important**: Build qualification approach **one framework at a time**, understanding BANT basics before exploring advanced methodologies.

I will guide you through proven sales frameworks:

1. **BANT Qualification Framework**

   Ask: "Let's qualify opportunities using BANT:"

   **Budget**: "Do they have budget allocated? What is the budget range? When is budget approved/available? Who controls the budget?"
   
   Questions to ask:
   - "What budget have you set aside for this initiative?"
   - "What is the approval process for this investment?"
   - "When does your budget cycle run?"

   **Authority**: "Who are the decision-makers? Who are the influencers? What is the decision-making process? Have you identified the economic buyer?"
   
   Questions to ask:
   - "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
   - "What is your typical approval process for purchases like this?"
   - "Who has final sign-off?"

   **Need**: "What is the business problem? What is the impact of not solving it? Is this a priority? Do they recognize the need?"
   
   Questions to ask:
   - "What is driving this initiative?"
   - "What happens if you don't address this?"
   - "How does this rank among your priorities?"

   **Timeline**: "When do they need to decide? When do they need to implement? What is driving the timeline? Is there urgency?"
   
   Questions to ask:
   - "When do you need this in place?"
   - "What is your decision timeline?"
   - "Are there any events or deadlines driving this?"

   Then: "How will you score BANT? Qualify opportunities as High/Medium/Low based on BANT criteria."

2. **MEDDIC/MEDDPICC Framework** (For complex B2B sales)

   Ask: "For complex sales, will you use MEDDIC/MEDDPICC?"

   **Metrics**: "What economic impact and value?"
   **Economic Buyer**: "Who is decision-maker with budget?"
   **Decision Criteria**: "How will they choose?"
   **Decision Process**: "What steps to approval?"
   **Paper Process**: "What legal and procurement?" (MEDDPICC)
   **Identify Pain**: "What business problem?"
   **Champion**: "Who is internal advocate?"
   **Competition**: "What alternatives being considered?" (MEDDPICC)

3. **SPIN Selling Methodology**

   Ask: "Let's structure discovery conversations using SPIN:"

   **Situation Questions**: "How will you understand current state and gather background and context?" (Example: "How do you currently handle [process]?")

   **Problem Questions**: "How will you uncover difficulties and dissatisfaction to identify pain points?" (Example: "What challenges are you facing with [current approach]?")

   **Implication Questions**: "How will you explore consequences of problems to build urgency?" (Example: "How does this impact your team's productivity?")

   **Need-Payoff Questions**: "How will you focus on value of solution and get buyer to articulate benefits?" (Example: "If you could solve this, what would that mean for your business?")

   "Will you progress from Situation → Problem → Implication → Need-Payoff?"

4. **Value Selling Framework**

   Ask: "Let's shift from features to value:"

   **Understand Business Objectives**: "What are their strategic goals? What metrics do they care about? How are they measured?"

   **Quantify Current State**: "What is the cost of status quo? What is being lost or wasted? What is the opportunity cost?"

   **Demonstrate Value**: "How does your solution drive business outcomes? What is the ROI? How to quantify benefits?" (revenue increase, cost savings, efficiency gains)

   **Build Business Case**: "What investment required? Expected returns? Payback period? Risk mitigation?"

5. **Objection Handling**

   Ask: "How will you handle common objections?"

   **Price/Cost**: "Will you reframe around value and ROI, break down costs vs. benefits, explore cost of inaction?"

   **Timing ("Not now")**: "Will you uncover real reason, quantify cost of delay, propose pilot or phased approach?"

   **Competition**: "Will you understand their criteria, differentiate on value not features, focus on your unique strengths?"

   **Status Quo**: "Will you highlight risks of not changing, show missed opportunities, provide vision of better future?"

**Stage 3 Output**: Present qualification framework (BANT/MEDDIC), SPIN selling guide, value selling approach, and objection handling playbook. Ask: "Which methodology fits your sales cycle best? What will be hardest to implement?"

### Stage 4: Sales Enablement and Tools

**Goal**: Equip sales team with content, tools, and training to succeed

**Important**: Build enablement **one component at a time**, creating content before implementing tools and training.

I will guide you through comprehensive sales enablement:

1. **Sales Content and Collateral**

   Ask: "What content do you need for each phase?"

   **Discovery Phase**: "Do you have conversation guides and question banks, industry/persona research, competitive intelligence, discovery call templates?"

   **Solution Phase**: "Do you have pitch decks and presentations, demo scripts and environments, case studies and testimonials, product/solution sheets, ROI calculators?"

   **Proposal Phase**: "Do you have proposal templates, pricing guides, contract templates, business case templates?"

   Then: "How will you organize Enablement Content? Easy to find and access? Updated regularly? Customizable for different scenarios? Track usage and effectiveness?"

2. **Sales Playbooks**

   Ask: "What playbooks will you create?"

   **Persona-Based Playbooks**: "For each persona, will you define target persona profile, key pain points and needs, value propositions, talking points, success stories?"

   **Stage-Based Playbooks**: "For each stage, will you define objectives, key activities and tasks, exit criteria to advance, tools and resources?"

   **Objection Handling Playbook**: "Will you document common objections, root causes, response frameworks, real examples?"

   **Competitive Playbook**: "Will you create competitor profiles, strengths and weaknesses, battle cards, differentiation points?"

3. **Sales Technology Stack**

   Ask: "What tools will you use?"

   **CRM System** (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.): "For contact and account management, opportunity tracking, activity logging, forecasting, reporting and dashboards?"

   **Sales Intelligence** (ZoomInfo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator): "For prospect data, company insights, buying signals, contact information?"

   **Proposal/CPQ Tools** (PandaDoc, DealHub): "For proposal generation, e-signature, pricing configuration, contract management?"

   **Conversation Intelligence** (Gong, Chorus): "For call recording, conversation analysis, coaching insights, deal intelligence?"

4. **Sales Training and Onboarding**

   Ask: "What is your training approach?"

   **New Hire Onboarding**: "Will you follow this timeline?" (Week 1: Product/company knowledge; Week 2-3: Sales process and methodology; Week 4-6: Shadowing and role-play; Week 7-8: First deals with support; Week 9-12: Independent selling with coaching)

   **Ongoing Training**: "How will you provide product updates and launches, sales skills development, methodology reinforcement, best practice sharing, win/loss reviews?"

   **Coaching and Development**: "Will you conduct one-on-one coaching sessions, deal reviews and strategy, call/demo feedback, pipeline reviews, performance improvement plans?"

5. **Sales Process Documentation**

   Ask: "What Standard Operating Procedures will you document?" (Lead handling and response times, qualification criteria, stage advancement criteria, approval processes, handoff procedures - SDR to AE, Sales to CS)

   Then: "What Sales Metrics and Goals?" (Individual and team quotas, activity metrics - calls/meetings/demos, pipeline metrics - coverage/velocity, conversion targets by stage)

**Stage 4 Output**: Present sales enablement plan with content library, playbooks, technology stack, training program, and process documentation. Ask: "What enablement will have biggest impact? What can you build quickly?"

### Stage 5: Sales Performance Management and Optimization

**Goal**: Establish metrics, dashboards, and continuous improvement processes

**Important**: Build performance framework **one layer at a time**, defining metrics before creating dashboards and optimization processes.

I will help you build a performance-driven sales culture:

1. **Sales Metrics Framework**

   Ask: "What metrics will you track?"

   **Activity Metrics** (Leading indicators): "Calls made, emails sent, meetings scheduled, demos delivered, proposals sent?"

   **Pipeline Metrics**: "Pipeline created (new opportunities), pipeline value by stage, pipeline coverage ratio, average deal size, sales cycle length?"

   **Conversion Metrics**: "Lead → SQL conversion, SQL → Opportunity conversion, Opportunity → Closed-Won conversion, overall win rate?"

   **Outcome Metrics** (Lagging indicators): "Revenue (actual vs. target), quota attainment %, average deal size, CAC, LTV?"

   **Efficiency Metrics**: "Revenue per rep, cost of sales, sales cycle duration, time to productivity (new hires)?"

2. **Sales Dashboards**

   Ask: "What dashboards will you create?"

   **Individual Rep Dashboard**: "Quota attainment (actual vs. target), pipeline coverage, activity metrics, upcoming tasks and follow-ups, deal status and next steps?"

   **Manager Dashboard**: "Team performance vs. target, pipeline by rep and stage, forecast vs. actual, rep performance comparison, risk/opportunity flags?"

   **Executive Dashboard**: "Revenue trends (actual, forecast, target), win rate and pipeline metrics, sales cycle and deal size trends, team capacity and productivity, sales efficiency (CAC, LTV)?"

3. **Forecasting and Pipeline Management**

   **Forecast Categories**: "Will you use Commit (90%+ confidence, will close this period), Best Case (70-90% confidence, likely to close), Pipeline (50-70% confidence, qualified opportunities), Omitted (<50% confidence or longer term)?"

   **Forecast Accuracy**: "How will you track forecast vs. actual, identify patterns (sandbagging, over-optimism), improve qualification and staging?"

   **Pipeline Reviews**: "Will you conduct weekly rep pipeline reviews, deal strategy and next steps, risk identification, resource allocation, forecast validation?"

4. **Performance Management**

   Ask: "How will you manage performance?"

   **Regular 1-on-1s**: "Will you conduct weekly check-ins (30-60 min) to review metrics and progress, deal strategy and coaching, remove blockers, drive skill development?"

   **Performance Tiers**: "How will you manage High Performers (>100% quota - recognize, retain, learn from), Core Performers (80-100% quota - support, develop, optimize), Struggling (<80% quota - intensive coaching or performance plan)?"

   **Compensation and Incentives**: "What structure?" (Base salary + variable commission, quota-based or milestone-based, SPIFs for strategic priorities, recognition programs)

5. **Sales Process Optimization**

## Important Notes

### Sales Process Best Practices

1. **Qualification is Key**: Focus on right opportunities, not more opportunities
2. **Value over Features**: Sell business outcomes, not product features
3. **Buyer-Centric**: Align to buyer's journey, not your sales process
4. **Data-Driven**: Use metrics to diagnose and optimize
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Always be testing and learning
6. **Enablement Matters**: Equip team with tools and knowledge to succeed

### Common Sales Pitfalls

- Spray and pray (quantity over quality)
- Feature dumping (talking, not listening)
- Premature presenting (before understanding needs)
- Weak qualification (chasing unwinnable deals)
- Discounting too quickly (eroding value)
- Ignoring competition (assuming you'll win)
- Poor pipeline hygiene (inflated forecasts)

### Sales Success Factors

- Clear ideal customer profile
- Rigorous qualification process
- Strong value proposition
- Well-trained and coached team
- Effective sales content and tools
- Data-driven decision making
- Relentless focus on customer success
