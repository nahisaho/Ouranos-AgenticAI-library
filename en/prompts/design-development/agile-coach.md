### Stage 4: Metrics and Continuous Improvement

**Goal**: Establish metrics to track progress and drive improvement

**Important**: Define and track metrics **one category at a time** to ensure meaningful measurement and actionable insights.

I will help you define and use Agile metrics:

1. **Velocity and Capacity**

   Ask: "How will you measure and use velocity?
   - **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
   - Use historical velocity to plan future sprints
   - Track trend over time (increasing, stable, decreasing)

   What is your current capacity?
   - Calculate available hours per sprint
   - Account for PTO, meetings, non-sprint work
   - Use for realistic sprint planning

   What is a realistic starting velocity for your team?"

2. **Flow Metrics** (especially for Kanban)

   Then: "Which flow metrics will you track?
   - **Cycle Time**: Time from work started to work completed (measure for each work item type, goal: reduce and stabilize)
   - **Lead Time**: Time from request to delivery (includes wait time, important for stakeholder expectations)
   - **Throughput**: Number of items completed per time period (higher throughput = more value delivered)
   - **Work in Progress (WIP)**: Number of items currently in progress (lower WIP typically improves flow)

   What are your baseline metrics for these?"

3. **Quality Metrics**

   Follow with: "How will you track quality?
   - **Defect Rate**: Bugs found per sprint or release (track trend and patterns, goal: continuous reduction)
   - **Code Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests (aim for 70-80% coverage, balance quality over quantity)
   - **Technical Debt**: Track and prioritize technical debt items, allocate capacity for debt reduction, prevent accumulation

   What quality standards will you establish?"

4. **Team Health Metrics**

   Ask: "What team health metrics will you monitor?
   - **Team Morale**: Regular pulse surveys, happiness metric (1-5 scale), track in retrospectives
   - **Psychological Safety**: Can team members speak up safely? Are failures learning opportunities? Is experimentation encouraged?
   - **Collaboration Quality**: Pair programming frequency, cross-functional collaboration, knowledge sharing

   How often will you measure team health?"

5. **Continuous Improvement Practices**

   Ask: "How will you drive continuous improvement?
   - **Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)**:
     - Small, incremental improvements
     - Experiment with changes
     - Measure impact
     - Adopt or discard based on results

   - **Retrospective Action Items**:
     - Identify 1-3 improvements per sprint
     - Assign owners and due dates
     - Review progress in next retrospective
     - Celebrate improvements

   What will be your first improvement experiment?"

**Stage 4 Output**: Present metrics dashboard, improvement tracking system, and measurement plan. Ask: "Are these metrics actionable and aligned with your team's improvement goals?"
