## Dialogue Flow

### Stage 1: Policy Problem Definition and Context

**Goal**: Clearly define the policy problem and understand the context

**Important**: Define the policy problem **one aspect at a time** to ensure comprehensive understanding of the issue and its context.

Explore the following areas:

1. **Problem Identification**

   Ask: "What is the policy problem you need to analyze?
   - What is the policy problem or issue?
   - How is the problem currently manifested?
     - Who is affected and how?
     - What is the scale/magnitude?
     - Where does it occur? (geographic scope)
   - Is this a new problem or longstanding issue?
   - What triggered attention to this problem now?
     - Crisis or event
     - Media attention
     - Advocacy pressure
     - Political priority"

2. **Problem Analysis**

   Then: "What are the root causes of this problem?
   - **Root Causes**: What are the underlying causes?
     - Economic factors (poverty, unemployment, cost of living)
     - Social factors (family breakdown, social isolation)
     - Political factors (policy failures, lack of will)
     - Structural/systemic issues (inequality, discrimination)
     - Behavioral factors (individual choices, habits)
   
   - **Current Situation**:
     - What is the baseline/status quo?
     - Trends over time (getting better/worse/stable?)
     - Data and evidence on problem magnitude
   
   - **Problem Definition**:
     - Frame the problem clearly and concisely
     - Example: 'Rising homelessness in City X: 5,000 individuals experiencing homelessness, up 30% in 3 years, driven by housing costs and service gaps'"

3. **Policy Context**

   Follow with: "What is the policy and political context?
   - **Jurisdiction and Authority**:
     - What level of government? (federal, state, local)
     - Who has authority to act?
     - Legal and constitutional constraints
   
   - **Existing Policies**:
     - What policies currently address this issue?
     - Why are current policies insufficient?
     - Are there policy gaps or conflicts?
   
   - **Political Context**:
     - Political feasibility considerations
     - Current political climate and priorities
     - Upcoming elections or deadlines
     - Public opinion and support
   
   - **Resource Constraints**:
     - Budget constraints and fiscal realities
     - Administrative capacity (staff, expertise)
     - Time constraints and urgency"

4. **Stakeholder Landscape**

   Ask: "Who are the key stakeholders and what are their interests?
   - Who are the key stakeholders?
     - **Directly affected**: Those experiencing the problem
     - **Service providers**: Organizations delivering services
     - **Policymakers**: Elected officials, agency leaders
     - **Advocacy groups**: Organizations pushing for change
     - **Opposition**: Those who may resist change
     - **Funders**: Those providing resources (taxpayers, foundations)
     - **General public**: Taxpayers, voters, community members
   
   - What are their interests and positions on the issue?
   - Who has power and influence to affect policy outcomes?"

5. **Goals and Objectives**

   Ask: "What outcomes do you want to achieve?
   - What are the desired outcomes?
   - Are goals clearly defined and specific?
   - Are they measurable and time-bound?
   - Example: 'Reduce homelessness by 25% within 3 years'
   - Are there competing or conflicting goals among stakeholders?"

**Stage 1 Output**: Present clear problem statement with context, stakeholder map, and goals. Ask: "Does this problem definition capture the issue comprehensively?"

---

### Stage 2: Policy Options Development

**Goal**: Identify and develop alternative policy options to address the problem

**Important**: Develop policy options **one at a time** to ensure thorough specification and comparison of alternatives.

I will guide you through generating policy alternatives:

1. **Policy Option Generation**

   Ask: "What policy options could address this problem?

   **Brainstorming Alternatives**:
   - What are possible policy responses?
   - Consider multiple categories:
     - **Regulatory**: Rules, standards, mandates, prohibitions
     - **Financial**: Taxes, subsidies, grants, incentives, fees
     - **Service delivery**: Direct provision of services by government
     - **Information**: Education, awareness campaigns, disclosure requirements
     - **Market-based**: Create markets, pricing mechanisms, cap-and-trade
     - **Procedural**: Change processes, coordination, governance structures
   
   **Sources of Ideas**:
   - **Best practices**: What works elsewhere? (other jurisdictions, countries)
   - **Research evidence**: What does evidence suggest? (evaluations, studies)
   - **Stakeholder input**: What do affected parties propose?
   - **Theory**: What does policy theory suggest? (economic theory, behavioral science)
   - **Innovation**: Novel approaches or adaptations

   **Example - Affordable Housing Policy Options**:
   1. **Regulatory**: Inclusionary zoning (require % of affordable units in new developments)
   2. **Financial**: Housing vouchers for low-income families
   3. **Service delivery**: Build public housing
   4. **Financial incentive**: Tax credits for developers building affordable housing
   5. **Regulatory reform**: Streamline zoning to allow more housing construction
   6. **Hybrid**: Combination of above

   What policy instruments are most appropriate for this problem?"

2. **Policy Option Specification**

   Then: "How will you specify each policy option in detail?

   **For Each Option, Define**:

   **Objectives**: What would this policy achieve?

   **Target Population**: Who would benefit?

   **Mechanism**: How would it work?
   - Key activities
   - Implementation process
   - Theory of change (how activities lead to outcomes)

   **Example - Housing Voucher Program**:
   ```
   Objective: Enable low-income families to afford housing in private market
   
   Target: Families earning <50% of area median income
   
   Mechanism:
   - Government provides rental subsidy (voucher)
   - Family pays 30% of income toward rent
   - Voucher covers difference up to fair market rent
   - Family finds housing in private market
   - Government pays landlord directly
   
   Theory of Change:
   Voucher → Increases purchasing power → Families can afford market-rate housing → Reduced homelessness & housing instability
   ```

   **Scope and Scale**:
   - How many people served?
   - Geographic coverage?
   - Duration (pilot vs. permanent program)?

   **Key Design Elements**:
   - Eligibility criteria (who qualifies?)
   - Benefit levels (how much assistance?)
   - Administrative structure (who manages it?)
   - Enforcement mechanisms (how is compliance ensured?)

   Can you specify the details for each option?"

3. **Stakeholder Analysis of Options**

   Follow with: "How will stakeholders respond to each option?

   **Stakeholder Analysis Matrix**:

   | Stakeholder | Interest/Position | Impact on Them | Their Power/Influence | Strategy |
   |-------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|----------|
   | Low-income families | Support (benefit directly) | High positive | Low | Coalition building |
   | Landlords | Mixed (income vs. regulation) | Medium | Medium | Engage, address concerns |
   | Developers | Support tax credit option | High positive | High | Partnership |
   | Taxpayers | Concerned about cost | Medium negative | Medium | Communication on ROI |
   | Affordable housing advocates | Strong support | High | Medium | Mobilize support |
   | Local govt officials | Mixed (need vs. budget) | High | High | Build evidence case |

   **Anticipating Opposition**:
   - Who will oppose each option?
   - What are their objections?
   - How can objections be addressed or mitigated?

   What strategies will you use to manage stakeholder concerns?"

4. **Theory of Change Development**

   Ask: "How will each policy option lead to desired outcomes?

   **Theory of Change (ToC)** maps how policy inputs lead to outcomes:

   ```
   Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes → Impact
   ```

   **Example - Housing Voucher Program ToC**:
   ```
   INPUTS:
   - $50M annual budget
   - Administrative staff
   - IT system for voucher management
   
   ACTIVITIES:
   - Process applications
   - Determine eligibility
   - Issue vouchers
   - Inspect housing units
   - Process payments to landlords
   
   OUTPUTS:
   - 5,000 vouchers issued annually
   - 90% of vouchers utilized
   
   SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES:
   - Families secure stable housing
   - Reduced housing cost burden (from 50% to 30% of income)
   
   MEDIUM-TERM OUTCOMES:
   - Improved housing stability
   - Children attend school consistently
   - Health improvements
   
   LONG-TERM IMPACT:
   - Reduced homelessness (25% reduction)
   - Improved life outcomes for low-income families
   - Stronger community stability
   
   ASSUMPTIONS:
   - Sufficient housing stock available in market
   - Landlords willing to accept vouchers
   - Families can navigate housing search process
   ```

   Can you map the theory of change for each option?"

5. **Status Quo Option**

   Ask: "What happens if you take no action?

   **Always Include Status Quo**:
   - "Do nothing" or continue current policy as baseline
   - Provides baseline for comparison with alternatives
   - What happens if no action taken?
   - Trends and projections under status quo (problem getting worse/better?)

   What is the likely trajectory under current policies?"

**Stage 2 Output**: Present clearly specified policy options (typically 3-5 options) with theories of change. Ask: "Do these options represent viable alternatives to address the problem?"

---

### Stage 3: Policy Evaluation and Analysis

**Goal**: Systematically evaluate policy options using multiple criteria

**Important**: Evaluate policy options **one criterion at a time** to ensure rigorous, comprehensive analysis.

I will guide you through rigorous policy evaluation:

1. **Evaluation Criteria**

   Ask: "What criteria will you use to evaluate options?

   **Common Policy Evaluation Criteria**:

   **Effectiveness**:
   - Will it solve the problem?
   - To what extent?
   - Evidence that similar policies work?
   - Likelihood of achieving stated goals?

   **Efficiency**:
   - Cost relative to benefits?
   - Are there more efficient alternatives?
   - Administrative costs reasonable?

   **Equity**:
   - Who benefits and who bears costs?
   - Does it reduce or increase disparities?
   - Are vulnerable populations protected?
   - Distributional impacts?

   **Feasibility**:
   - Political feasibility (can it get approved/supported?)
   - Administrative feasibility (can it be implemented?)
   - Legal feasibility (is it legal/constitutional?)
   - Technical feasibility (do we know how to do it?)

   **Sustainability**:
   - Financially sustainable over time?
   - Politically sustainable (will it survive changes in govt)?
   - Environmentally sustainable?

   **Additional Criteria** (context-specific):
   - Speed of implementation (how quickly can it be deployed?)
   - Flexibility/adaptability (can it adjust to changing conditions?)
   - Public acceptability (will the public support it?)
   - Unintended consequences (positive or negative side effects?)

   What criteria are most important for this decision?"

2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**

   Then: "What are the costs and benefits of each option?

   **Purpose**: Compare total costs to total benefits in monetary terms

   **Steps**:

   **1. Identify Costs**:
   - **Direct costs**: Program expenditures, administration
   - **Indirect costs**: Opportunity costs, displacement effects
   - **One-time costs**: Startup, capital
   - **Ongoing costs**: Operations, maintenance

   **2. Identify Benefits**:
   - **Direct benefits**: Intended outcomes (e.g., reduced homelessness)
   - **Indirect benefits**: Secondary effects (e.g., improved health, education)
   - **Monetize benefits**: Assign dollar values where possible

   **3. Time Horizon and Discounting**:
   - Analysis period (e.g., 10 years)
   - Discount future costs and benefits to present value
   - Typical discount rate: 3-7%

   **4. Calculate Net Present Value (NPV)**:
   - NPV = Present Value of Benefits - Present Value of Costs
   - If NPV > 0, benefits exceed costs

   **5. Benefit-Cost Ratio**:
   - BCR = Benefits / Costs
   - If BCR > 1, benefits exceed costs
   - Example: BCR of 2.5 means $2.50 in benefits per $1 spent

   **Example - Housing Voucher CBA (simplified)**:

   ```
   10-Year Analysis, 3% Discount Rate
   
   COSTS:
   - Voucher payments: $400M (PV)
   - Administration: $50M (PV)
   - TOTAL COSTS: $450M
   
   BENEFITS:
   - Avoided homelessness costs (shelter, emergency services): $300M
   - Improved health outcomes (reduced ER visits, hospitalizations): $150M
   - Improved education outcomes (increased earning potential): $200M
   - Reduced criminal justice costs: $50M
   - TOTAL BENEFITS: $700M
   
   NPV = $700M - $450M = $250M (positive)
   BCR = $700M / $450M = 1.56
   
   Conclusion: Benefits exceed costs; economically justified
   ```

   **Limitations of CBA**:
   - Difficult to monetize some benefits (e.g., dignity, well-being)
   - Distributional impacts not captured (who pays vs. who benefits)
   - Ethical issues with valuing lives or health

3. **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**

   Follow with: "If benefits are hard to monetize, what is the cost per outcome?

   **When to Use**: When benefits difficult to monetize but can be measured in natural units

   **Metric**: Cost per unit of outcome
   - Example: Cost per homeless person housed
   - Example: Cost per life saved
   - Example: Cost per student graduated

   **Example - Comparing Three Homelessness Programs**:

   | Option | Annual Cost | People Housed | Cost per Person Housed |
   |--------|-------------|---------------|------------------------|
   | Housing vouchers | $10M | 1,000 | $10,000 |
   | Transitional housing | $12M | 800 | $15,000 |
   | Permanent supportive housing | $15M | 600 | $25,000 |

   **Interpretation**:
   - Housing vouchers most cost-effective ($10K per person)
   - But: Different populations served, different long-term outcomes
   - Consider effectiveness + cost-effectiveness together

   What outcomes can you measure for comparison?"

4. **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis**

   Ask: "How do options compare across multiple criteria?

   **Evaluation Matrix**:

   | Criteria | Weight | Option A: Vouchers | Option B: Public Housing | Option C: Zoning Reform |
   |----------|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
   | **Effectiveness** | 30% | High (8) → 2.4 | Medium (6) → 1.8 | Medium (5) → 1.5 |
   | **Cost-Effectiveness** | 25% | High (9) → 2.25 | Low (4) → 1.0 | High (8) → 2.0 |
   | **Equity** | 20% | High (8) → 1.6 | High (9) → 1.8 | Low (4) → 0.8 |
   | **Political Feasibility** | 15% | Medium (6) → 0.9 | Low (3) → 0.45 | Medium (5) → 0.75 |
   | **Speed of Implementation** | 10% | High (8) → 0.8 | Low (3) → 0.3 | Medium (6) → 0.6 |
   | **TOTAL SCORE** | 100% | **7.95** | **5.35** | **5.65** |

   **Interpretation**: Option A (vouchers) scores highest overall

   **Notes**:
   - Weights reflect stakeholder priorities (can vary)
   - Scores subjective but structured (transparency important)
   - Sensitivity analysis: Test how results change with different weights

   What weights and scoring will you use?"

5. **Evidence Review**

   Ask: "What evidence supports each option?

   **Types of Evidence**:

   **Evaluation Studies**:
   - Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) - gold standard
   - Quasi-experimental designs
   - Pre-post comparisons
   - Case studies

   **Best Practices Research**:
   - What works elsewhere?
   - Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
   - Expert consensus

   **Local Data**:
   - Baseline data on problem
   - Feasibility data (available resources, capacity)

   **Example Evidence Summary - Housing First Approach**:
   ```
   Evidence Base: Strong
   - Multiple RCTs show Housing First reduces homelessness by 80-90%
   - Cost-effectiveness demonstrated in 15+ studies
   - Effective for chronically homeless with complex needs
   - Implementation examples in 100+ cities
   - Limitations: Requires supportive services; not all housing markets suitable
   ```

   What evidence is available for your options?"

**Stage 3 Output**: Present systematic evaluation of options with evidence, cost-benefit analysis, and recommendation. Ask: "Does this analysis provide sufficient basis for decision-making?"

---

### Stage 4: Implementation Planning and Feasibility

**Goal**: Assess how policy would be implemented and identify implementation challenges

**Important**: Plan implementation **one component at a time** to identify feasibility issues and resource needs.

I will guide you through implementation analysis:

1. **Implementation Design**

   Ask: "How will this policy be implemented in practice?

   **Key Implementation Questions**:
   - Who will implement? (agency, level of government)
   - What administrative capacity is required?
   - What new systems, processes, or infrastructure needed?
   - How will it be funded?
   - What is the timeline?
   - How will compliance be ensured?

   **Implementation Plan Components**:

   **Governance Structure**:
   - Lead agency and roles
   - Inter-agency coordination
   - Oversight and accountability

   **Operational Processes**:

   - Oversight by City Council Housing Committee
   - Annual reporting to Council and public
   
   OPERATIONAL PROCESS:
   1. Outreach and application (online and in-person)
   2. Eligibility verification (income, residency, background)
   3. Waitlist management (prioritization system)
   4. Housing search assistance
   5. Unit inspection and approval
   6. Lease signing and voucher issuance
   7. Monthly payment to landlord
   8. Annual recertification
   
   STAFFING:
   - 15 FTE staff (eligibility, inspections, payments)
   - Training: Fair housing, trauma-informed practices
   
   IT SYSTEMS:
   - Integrated eligibility and payment system ($2M investment)
   - Client portal for applications

   TIMELINE:
   - Months 1-3: System development, staff hiring, training
   - Months 4-6: Pilot with 500 vouchers
   - Months 7-12: Scale to 2,500 vouchers
   - Year 2+: Full implementation (5,000 vouchers)
   ```

   What implementation structure is needed?"

2. **Stakeholder Engagement Strategy**

   Then: "How will you engage stakeholders during implementation?

   **Why Engage Stakeholders?**
   - Build support and buy-in
   - Gather input to improve policy
   - Identify and mitigate opposition
   - Ensure implementation reflects needs

   **Engagement Activities**:

   **Public Consultation**:
   - Public hearings
   - Surveys
   - Focus groups

   - Key messages for different audiences
   - Communication channels
   - Transparency and reporting

   **Example Engagement Plan**:
   ```
   STAKEHOLDER: Low-income families (beneficiaries)
   - Engagement: Focus groups, surveys, advisory committee
   - Purpose: Design program to meet needs, reduce barriers
   - Timing: Throughout design and implementation
   
   STAKEHOLDER: Landlords
   - Engagement: Information sessions, incentives discussion
   - Purpose: Recruit participating landlords, address concerns
   - Timing: Before and during rollout
   
   STAKEHOLDER: City Council
   - Engagement: Briefings, hearings, votes
   - Purpose: Secure approval and funding
   - Timing: Policy development and budget cycle
   ```

   What stakeholder engagement is needed?"

3. **Risk Analysis and Mitigation**

   Follow with: "What could go wrong and how will you mitigate risks?

   **Implementation Risks**:

   **Political Risks**:
   - Leadership change
   - Budget cuts
   - Opposition mobilization
   - **Mitigation**: Build broad coalition, demonstrate early wins

   **Administrative Risks**:
   - Insufficient capacity
   - IT system failures
   - Delayed hiring
   - **Mitigation**: Phased rollout, technical assistance, contingency planning

   **Programmatic Risks**:
   - Lower than expected take-up
   - Unintended consequences
   - Fraud or misuse
   - **Mitigation**: Marketing/outreach, monitoring, fraud controls

   **External Risks**:
   - Economic downturn
   - Housing market changes
   - **Mitigation**: Flexible design, adaptive management

   **Risk Matrix Example**:

   | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
   |------|------------|--------|---------------------|
   | Insufficient landlord participation | Medium | High | Early landlord engagement, incentives, streamlined processes |
   | IT system delays | Medium | Medium | Start with manual processes, phased rollout |
   | Budget cuts after year 1 | Low | High | Multi-year funding commitment, demonstrate ROI |

   What are the key implementation risks?"

4. **Monitoring and Evaluation Plan**

   Ask: "How will you track progress and measure success?

   **Why Monitor and Evaluate?**
   - Track implementation progress
   - Measure outcomes
   - Identify problems early
   - Enable course corrections
   - Demonstrate accountability

   **Monitoring Plan**:

   **Process Indicators** (implementation):
   - Number of applications received
   - Average processing time
   - Vouchers issued vs. target
   - Utilization rate

   **Outcome Indicators** (results):
   - Number of people housed
   - Housing stability (% still housed after 1 year)
   - Reduction in homelessness
   - Cost per person housed

   **Data Collection**:
   - Administrative data (from program systems)
   - Surveys (participant satisfaction, outcomes)
   - External data (homelessness counts)

   **Reporting**:
   - Quarterly reports to oversight body
   - Annual public report
   - Dashboard for real-time monitoring

   **Evaluation Design**:
   - **Formative evaluation**: Early assessment to improve program (6 months)
   - **Summative evaluation**: Did it work? Impact evaluation (3 years)
   - **Methods**: Comparison group, pre-post analysis, qualitative interviews

   What will you measure?"

5. **Adaptive Management**

   Ask: "How will you adapt based on learning?

   **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Use data to make adjustments (data-driven decisions)
   - Regular review of implementation (quarterly reviews)
   - Stakeholder feedback loops (ongoing input)
   - Flexibility to adapt (responsive to conditions)

   **Decision Points**:
   - When to scale up? (success criteria)
   - When to modify design? (mid-course corrections)
   - When to discontinue if not working? (off-ramps)

   How will you ensure learning and adaptation?"

**Stage 4 Output**: Present implementation plan with governance, operations, stakeholder engagement, risk mitigation, and M&E plan. Ask: "Is this implementation plan feasible and realistic?"

---

### Stage 5: Policy Recommendation and Communication

**Goal**: Synthesize analysis into clear recommendation and communicate effectively

**Important**: Develop recommendations **one component at a time** and tailor communication for different audiences.

I will guide you through developing recommendations:

1. **Recommendation Development**

   Ask: "What is your policy recommendation?

   **Recommendation Statement**:
   - Clear, specific action
   - Based on analysis from previous stages
   - Addresses policy problem directly

   **Example Recommendation**:
   'The City should implement a Housing Choice Voucher program providing rental assistance to 5,000 low-income families annually, funded at $50M per year, to reduce homelessness by 25% within 3 years.'

   **Justification**:
   - Why this option? (evidence from evaluation)
   - How it addresses the problem
   - Benefits and expected outcomes
   - Costs and resource requirements

   **Recommendation Variants**:

   **Single Recommendation**: When one option clearly superior

   **Tiered Recommendations**:
   - Preferred option
   - Alternative option if preferred not feasible
   - Minimum action

   **Phased Recommendations**:
   - Phase 1: Pilot program (500 vouchers, 1 year)
   - Phase 2: Evaluation and adjustment
   - Phase 3: Full-scale implementation (5,000 vouchers)

   **Hybrid/Package Recommendations**:
   - Combine elements of multiple options
   - Example: Vouchers (primary) + zoning reform (complementary) + supportive services

   What format best communicates your recommendation?"

2. **Policy Brief Writing**

   Then: "How will you document your analysis and recommendation?

   **Policy Brief Structure**:

   ```markdown
   # [Title]: Clear, Action-Oriented

   - Clear, concise language (avoid jargon)
   - Evidence-based arguments
   - Objective tone (balanced, fair)
   - Visuals (tables, charts) to support key points

   What format will you use for the policy brief?"

3. **Tailoring Communication to Audiences**

   Follow with: "How will you adapt communication for different audiences?

   **For Policymakers/Elected Officials**:
   - Lead with recommendation
   - Focus on political considerations
   - Emphasize constituent benefits
   - Address likely objections
   - Clear ask/decision needed

   **For Technical/Staff Audience**:

   - Infographics and visuals

   **For Media**:
   - Sound bites and key messages (quotable phrases)
   - Human interest angle (real people affected)
   - Q&A on likely questions

   Who are your primary audiences?"

4. **Presenting Recommendations**

   Ask: "How will you present your recommendations to decision-makers?

   **Presentation Structure** (for decision-makers):

   **Opening** (2 min):

   - How it would work
   - Timeline and costs
   - Risks and mitigation

   **Conclusion** (1 min):
   - Expected impact
   - Next steps/decision needed

   **Q&A**: Prepare for tough questions

   **Presentation Tips**:
   - Visuals over text (charts, infographics)
   - Tell a story (narrative arc)
   - Use data strategically (key numbers, not overwhelming)
   - Anticipate objections (prepare responses)
   - Be ready to adapt based on reactions (read the room)

   Are you prepared to present and defend your recommendation?"

**Stage 5 Output**: Present policy brief and presentation materials tailored to key audiences. Ask: "Does this communication clearly convey your recommendation and rationale?"

5. **Addressing Objections**

   **Common Objections and Responses**:

   **"It costs too much"**:
   - Response: Cost-benefit analysis shows benefits exceed costs
   - Return on investment
   - Cost of inaction (status quo costs)
   - Phased approach to spread costs

   **"It won't work"**:
   - Response: Evidence from similar programs
   - Success stories from other jurisdictions
   - Pilot approach to test and refine

   **"It's not our responsibility"**:
   - Response: Legal/moral obligation
   - Costs of not addressing (impacts on other systems)
   - Partnership/shared responsibility approach

   **"There are unintended consequences"**:
   - Response: Risk mitigation plan
   - Monitoring to catch issues early
   - Flexibility to adjust

   **"Political opposition too strong"**:
   - Response: Stakeholder engagement to build coalition
   - Frame to appeal to different values
   - Incremental approach

**Stage 5 Output**: Clear recommendation with policy brief and presentation materials

## Usage Example

### Scenario: Addressing Youth Unemployment in State X

**Stage 1: Problem Definition**

**Problem**: Youth (ages 16-24) unemployment in State X is 18%, double the state average, affecting 50,000 young people. Concentrated in urban areas and among youth of color.

**Root Causes**: Skills mismatch, lack of work experience, educational barriers, discrimination

**Goals**: Reduce youth unemployment to 10% within 3 years

**Stakeholders**: Youth, employers, schools, workforce agencies, advocacy groups

**Stage 2: Policy Options**

**Option A**: Youth job training and apprenticeship program
**Option B**: Subsidized employment for employers hiring youth
**Option C**: Comprehensive youth development program (training + support services)
**Status Quo**: Existing workforce programs (minimal youth focus)

**Stage 3: Evaluation**

**Cost-Benefit Analysis** (Option A - Job Training):
- Cost: $30M over 3 years
- Benefits: Increased earnings ($50M PV), reduced public assistance ($10M), reduced criminal justice costs ($5M)
- NPV: $35M, BCR: 2.2

**Evaluation Matrix**:
- Option C (comprehensive) scores highest on effectiveness and equity
- Option A (training) highest on cost-effectiveness
- Option B (subsidies) highest on political feasibility

**Recommendation**: Implement Option C (comprehensive program) with elements of A and B

**Stage 4: Implementation**

**Lead Agency**: State Workforce Development Board
**Partners**: Community colleges, employers, youth-serving nonprofits
**Timeline**: 6-month design, 18-month pilot (5 cities, 2,000 youth), evaluation, then statewide
**Budget**: $15M Year 1 (pilot), $40M Years 2-3 (scale-up)

**Stage 5: Policy Brief and Presentation**

**Policy Brief** (3 pages) prepared for Governor and Legislature
**Presentation** delivered to Governor's Cabinet
**Outcome**: Program approved with $15M initial funding for pilot

## Important Notes

### Policy Analysis Best Practices

1. **Evidence-Based**: Ground in research and data
2. **Rigorous**: Systematic evaluation of options
3. **Transparent**: Show your work, assumptions
4. **Realistic**: Acknowledge constraints, tradeoffs
5. **Stakeholder-Informed**: Engage those affected
6. **Actionable**: Clear, implementable recommendations
7. **Ethical**: Consider equity and values

### Common Pitfalls

- Advocacy disguised as analysis (predetermined conclusion)
- Ignoring political feasibility
- Weak problem definition
- Inadequate option development (only one real option)
- Cherry-picking evidence
- Failure to consider implementation
- Overpromising results

### Success Factors

- Clear problem definition
- Multiple genuine alternatives
