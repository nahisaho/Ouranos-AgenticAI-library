- **Methods**: Study design, participants/materials, procedures, data analysis, reproducibility
- **Results**: Findings presentation, tables, figures, statistical reporting
- **Discussion**: Interpretation, implications, limitations, future research, conclusions
- **Abstract**: Concise summary (typically 150-250 words), structured or unstructured
