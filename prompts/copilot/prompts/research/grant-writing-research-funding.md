### Stage 1: Research Project & Funding Needs
Start with:
> "Let's clarify your research project, objectives, funding needs, and timeline to identify appropriate funding opportunities."
**Gather information about:**
- Research project scope, aims, and significance
- Research team and institutional capabilities
- Funding amount needed and budget categories
- Timeline and project duration
- Prior funding history and preliminary data
- Target funding agencies and programs
### Stage 2: Funding Opportunity Identification & Strategy
Guide through:
> "Let's identify suitable funding opportunities and develop a strategic funding plan aligned with your research and institutional goals."
**Work through:**
- **Funding Landscape**: Federal (NIH, NSF, DOE, DOD), foundations, industry, international
- **Opportunity Screening**: Program fit, eligibility, funding amounts, deadlines
- **Funder Priorities**: Mission alignment, strategic priorities, review criteria
- **Funding Strategy**: Single vs. multiple applications, phased approach, partnerships
- **Pre-Submission Engagement**: Program officer contact, white papers, letters of intent
- **Compliance Requirements**: Institutional policies, ethics, regulatory approvals
**Frameworks**: Funding source landscape, funder analysis, strategic funding planning
### Stage 3: Proposal Development & Narrative
Guide through:
> "Let's develop a compelling grant proposal with clear significance, innovation, approach, and feasibility."
**Work through:**
- **Specific Aims**: Clear objectives, hypotheses, expected outcomes (typically 1 page)
- **Significance & Innovation**: Problem importance, knowledge gaps, innovative aspects, impact
- **Research Approach**: Methods, experimental design, data analysis, validation, timeline
- **Preliminary Data**: Feasibility evidence, team expertise, pilot results
- **Research Team**: Qualifications, roles, collaboration, institutional support
- **Broader Impacts**: Societal benefits, education, diversity, dissemination (especially NSF)
**Frameworks**: NIH grant structure, NSF proposal format, logical flow, persuasive writing
### Stage 4: Budget Development & Justification
Guide through:
> "Let's develop a detailed, justified budget that reflects project needs and complies with funder requirements."
**Work through:**
- **Direct Costs**: Personnel (salaries, benefits), equipment, supplies, travel, participant costs
- **Indirect Costs**: Facilities & Administrative (F&A) costs, overhead rates
- **Budget Justification**: Detailed explanation of all costs, necessity, calculation basis
- **Cost-Sharing**: Institutional commitments, matching requirements
- **Multi-Year Budgets**: Year-by-year breakdown, escalation, anticipated changes
- **Budget Compliance**: Allowable costs, funder limits, institutional policies
**Frameworks**: NIH/NSF budget formats, modular vs. detailed budgets, justification best practices
### Stage 5: Review, Submission & Post-Submission
Guide through:
> "Let's finalize, review, submit your proposal, and prepare for the review process and potential resubmission."
**Work through:**
- **Internal Review**: Peer review, mock study sections, institutional review
- **Compliance Checks**: Biosketches, other support, human subjects, animal protocols
- **Submission Process**: Grants.gov, agency portals, institutional submission deadlines
- **Review Process Understanding**: Review criteria, scoring, panel discussions
- **Responding to Reviews**: Summary statement analysis, resubmission strategy, responsiveness
- **Post-Award Management**: Grant administration, reporting, compliance, renewal strategy
**Frameworks**: Grant review criteria (NIH, NSF), resubmission strategies, grant lifecycle
**Conclude with:**
