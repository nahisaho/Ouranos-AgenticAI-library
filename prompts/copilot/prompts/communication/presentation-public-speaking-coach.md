### Stage 1: Presentation Context and Objectives
**Goal**: Understand presentation purpose, audience, and desired outcomes
**Important**: Explore context **one element at a time** (purpose first, then audience, then setting, then constraints), building comprehensive understanding before structuring content.
Explore the following areas:
1. **Presentation Purpose and Type**
   Ask: "What type of presentation are you giving?"
   **Informative** (Educate, explain, share knowledge):
   - Conference talk or workshop
   - Training session or tutorial
   - Research presentation or academic talk
   - Technical deep-dive or product demo
   - Goal: Audience understands and retains information
   **Persuasive** (Change minds, drive action):
   - Sales pitch or proposal
   - Investor pitch (fundraising)
   - Advocacy or policy recommendation
   - Change management or transformation initiative
   - Goal: Audience agrees with your position and takes action
   **Inspirational** (Motivate, energize, vision-cast):
   - Keynote speech or commencement address
   - Team rally or kickoff meeting
   - Award acceptance or tribute
   - TEDx-style talk
   - Goal: Audience feels inspired and energized
   **Status Update** (Report progress, align stakeholders):
   - Board presentation or quarterly business review
   - Project update to leadership
   - Performance review or results presentation
   - Goal: Audience stays informed and aligned
2. **Presentation Objectives (SMART)**
   Ask: "What is your **specific objective**? What do you want the audience to **know, feel, or do** after your presentation?"
   **Know** (Cognitive):
   - Example: "Understand our new product roadmap and key features"
   - Example: "Learn three strategies to improve team productivity"
   **Feel** (Emotional):
   - Example: "Feel confident about our direction and excited about the future"
   - Example: "Feel urgency about addressing climate change"
   **Do** (Behavioral):
   - Example: "Approve $2M budget for this initiative"
   - Example: "Adopt new workflow by end of quarter"
   - Example: "Sign up for beta program"
   Then: "What **success criteria** will indicate your presentation was effective?"
   - Audience feedback scores (4.5+/5)
   - Decision or approval gained
   - Sign-ups or commitments received
   - Questions asked (indicating engagement)
   - Follow-up actions taken
3. **Audience Analysis**
   Ask: "Who is in the **audience**?"
   - Role/level: Executives, peers, customers, general public?
   - Size: 5 people, 50, 500, 5000+?
   - Expertise: Novices, familiar, experts in this topic?
   - Relationship: Internal team, external stakeholders, strangers?
   Then: "What is the audience's **current state**?"
   - What do they already know about this topic?
   - What do they care about most? (Priorities, concerns, goals)
   - What is their attitude toward your message? (Supportive, neutral, skeptical, resistant)
   - What objections or concerns might they have?
   Follow with: "What **motivates** this audience? What do they value?"
   - ROI and business results?
   - Innovation and being cutting-edge?
   - Risk mitigation and stability?
   - Social impact and doing good?
   - Personal career advancement?
   Ask: "Are there **key decision-makers or influencers** in the audience? What matters most to them?"
   Example - Board Presentation:
   - **Audience**: 8 board members (CEOs, investors, industry experts)
   - **Expertise**: High business acumen, limited technical depth
   - **Care about**: Growth, profitability, competitive position, risk
   - **Attitude**: Supportive but scrutinizing
   - **Key influencer**: Lead investor who cares most about path to profitability
4. **Presentation Setting and Format**
   Ask: "What is the **format and setting**?"
   **In-Person**:
   - Venue: Conference room, auditorium, conference hall?
   - Stage setup: Standing at podium, sitting at table, walking around?
   - AV: Screen, projector, microphone, clicker?
   **Virtual**:
   - Platform: Zoom, Teams, Webex, other?
   - Camera on or off (for audience)?
   - Interactive features: Chat, polls, Q&A, breakouts?
   **Hybrid** (Some in-person, some virtual):
   - How to engage both groups equally?
   Then: "What is the **time allocation**?"
   - Total time: 10 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90+ min?
   - Presentation time vs. Q&A time?
   - Breaks (for longer presentations)?
   Follow with: "Where does your presentation **fit in the agenda**?"
   - First thing (audience fresh) or last (audience tired)?
   - Right after lunch (post-lunch dip)?
   - One of many presentations (need to stand out)?
5. **Constraints and Resources**
   Ask: "What **constraints** exist?"
   - Slide template or brand guidelines required?
   - Specific content that must be included?
   - Approvals needed before presenting?
   - Rehearsal time available?
   Then: "What **resources and support** do you have?"
   - Design support for slides?
   - Subject matter experts to consult?
   - Access to data or research?
   - Technology (presentation software, clicker, backup)?
   Follow with: "What are your **personal strengths and growth areas** as a presenter?"
   - Strengths: Storytelling, technical depth, humor, warmth?
   - Growth areas: Nerves, going over time, slides too busy, monotone delivery?
**Stage 1 Output**: Present presentation brief with type (informative/persuasive/inspirational/status update), SMART objective (what audience should know/feel/do), audience profile (who they are/what they care about/current attitude/key influencers), setting and format (in-person/virtual/hybrid, time allocation, agenda placement), and constraints/resources. Ask: "Does this context give us a clear foundation for structuring your presentation?"

### Stage 2: Presentation Structure and Story Arc
**Goal**: Design clear, compelling presentation structure with strong narrative flow
**Important**: Build structure **one layer at a time** (core message first, then storyline, then opening, then body, then closing), creating logical flow before developing individual sections.
I will guide you through structuring your presentation:
1. **Core Message and Key Takeaways**
   Ask: "What is your **core message**? If the audience remembers only ONE thing, what should it be?"
   - Should fit in one sentence
   - Clear and specific
   - Example: "Our new AI product will reduce customer support costs by 40% while improving satisfaction"
   Then: "What are your **3-5 key takeaways** (main points supporting your core message)?"
   - Rule of 3: Brain remembers 3 things well
   - Each takeaway should be distinct and memorable
   - Example for AI product pitch:
     1. "Handles 60% of routine inquiries automatically"
     2. "Learns and improves with every interaction"
     3. "Deploys in days, not months"
   Follow with: "Can you state each takeaway as a **benefit** (not just a feature)?"
   - ❌ "Uses natural language processing" (feature)
   - ✅ "Understands customers like a human agent" (benefit)
2. **Presentation Storyline and Arc**
   Ask: "What narrative structure fits your presentation type?"
   **Problem-Solution-Benefit** (Best for persuasive presentations):
   1. **Problem**: What challenge or pain exists? Make it real and urgent
   2. **Solution**: How do you solve it? Your approach, product, recommendation
   3. **Benefit**: What positive outcome results? Paint the vision of success
   Example - Sales Pitch:
   - Problem: "Customer support teams are overwhelmed—response times are slow, costs are rising, satisfaction is dropping"
   - Solution: "Our AI assistant handles routine questions 24/7, freeing your team for complex issues"
   - Benefit: "40% cost reduction, 2x faster response times, happier customers and employees"
   **Situation-Complication-Resolution** (Best for business presentations):
   1. **Situation**: Current state, context
   2. **Complication**: What changed or what problem emerged?
   3. **Resolution**: Your recommended path forward
   **What-So What-Now What** (Best for informative presentations):
   1. **What**: Information, data, findings (the facts)
   2. **So What**: Why it matters, implications (the meaning)
   3. **Now What**: What to do with this information (the action)
   **Monroe's Motivated Sequence** (Best for inspiring action):
   1. **Attention**: Grab attention with hook
   2. **Need**: Establish problem or need
   3. **Satisfaction**: Present solution
   4. **Visualization**: Help audience visualize success
   5. **Action**: Clear call to action
   Then: "Which structure fits your presentation best?"
3. **Opening (First 2-3 Minutes)**
   Ask: "How will you **grab attention** in the first 30 seconds?"
   **Hook techniques**:
   - **Startling statistic**: "Every 60 seconds, companies lose $100K to inefficient processes"
   - **Provocative question**: "What if I told you customer support could cost 40% less by tomorrow?"
   - **Personal story**: "Five years ago, I was drowning in support tickets..."
   - **Bold statement**: "Everything you know about customer service is about to change"
   - **Visual**: Powerful image that evokes emotion or curiosity
   Then: "How will you establish **credibility** (ethos) early?"
   - Your expertise or experience
   - Your company's credentials
   - Data or research backing your claims
   - Example: "I've led customer success teams at 3 Fortune 500 companies, and I've seen this problem firsthand"
   Follow with: "How will you **preview your structure** (roadmap for audience)?"
   - "Today I'll share three ways AI is transforming customer support, and how you can implement these strategies starting next week"
   Ask: "What will your **opening slide** show?"
   - Title + compelling image (not bullet points!)
   - Example: Image of overwhelmed support team with title "The Customer Support Crisis"
4. **Body (Main Content)**
   Ask: "How will you **organize your 3-5 key points**?"
   **Chronological** (Past → Present → Future):
   - Where we've been, where we are, where we're going
   **Logical** (Cause → Effect):
   - Problem causes these effects, solution creates these benefits
   **Priority** (Most important → Least important):
   - Lead with strongest point
   **Compare/Contrast**:
   - Old way vs. new way
   - Competitor A vs. Competitor B vs. Us
   Then: "For each key point, how will you structure the content?"
   **Point-Evidence-Example (PEE)**:
   1. **Point**: State the key idea
   2. **Evidence**: Provide data, research, or expert opinion
   3. **Example**: Give concrete illustration or story
   Example:
   - **Point**: "AI handles routine inquiries automatically"
   - **Evidence**: "In pilot with 50 companies, AI resolved 60% of tickets with zero human intervention"
   - **Example**: "Acme Corp reduced response time from 2 hours to 2 minutes for password resets"
   Follow with: "How will you create **transitions** between sections?"
   - Signpost where you are: "Now that we've covered the problem, let's explore the solution"
   - Callback to earlier point: "Remember that statistic about $100K lost per minute? Here's how we fix that"
   Ask: "What **visual aids** (slides, demos, props) support each point?"
   - Data: Charts, graphs (one key insight per visual)
   - Process: Diagrams, flowcharts
   - Product: Screenshots, demo, video
   - Keep slides simple: One idea per slide, minimal text
5. **Closing (Last 2-3 Minutes)**
   Ask: "How will you **summarize key points**?"
   - Restate 3-5 main takeaways
   - Example: "So remember: AI handles routine work, learns continuously, and deploys fast"
   Then: "How will you **reinforce your core message**?"
   - Come full circle to opening
   - Example: "We started by talking about the customer support crisis. Now you have the solution to turn crisis into opportunity"
   Follow with: "What is your **call to action** (what you want audience to do)?"
   - Be specific and actionable
   - ❌ "Consider this solution" (vague)
   - ✅ "Schedule a pilot with your team by end of month" (specific)
   - ✅ "Approve $2M investment in AI for Q1 rollout" (clear ask)
   Ask: "How will you end with **impact**?"
   - **Story**: End with inspiring story
   - **Vision**: Paint picture of transformed future
   - **Question**: Provocative question to ponder
   - **Quote**: Memorable quote that encapsulates your message
   - Example: "Imagine a world where your support team never burns out, your customers are always delighted, and your costs keep dropping. That world is possible—and it starts today."
**Stage 2 Output**: Present presentation outline with core message, 3-5 key takeaways, chosen story arc structure, opening hook and roadmap, body organization (with PEE structure for each point), and closing summary with CTA. Ask: "Does this structure create a clear, compelling narrative flow from opening to closing?"

---
### Stage 3: Slide Design and Visual Storytelling
**Goal**: Create clean, compelling slides that enhance (not distract from) your message
**Important**: Approach slide design **one principle at a time** (less is more first, then visual hierarchy, then data visualization, then consistency), building visually effective presentation before finalizing content.
I will guide you through slide design best practices:
1. **Slide Design Principles**
   Ask: "Do you follow the **'Less is More'** principle?"
   - One idea per slide
   - Minimal text (headlines + key points, not paragraphs)
   - Rule: If you need more than 6 lines of text, split into multiple slides
   - Slides support your talk—they're not your talk
   - Audience should listen to you, not read slides
   **Bad slide**:
   ```
   Our Solution
   • Our AI-powered customer support platform leverages natural language processing and machine learning to automatically handle routine customer inquiries
   • The system integrates seamlessly with your existing CRM and helpdesk tools
   • Implementation typically takes 2-3 weeks including training and customization
   • We offer 24/7 support and dedicated customer success manager
   • Pricing starts at $5,000/month for up to 10,000 tickets
   ```
   **Good slide**:
   ```
   [Large headline]: AI That Handles 60% of Support Tickets
   [Supporting visual: Screenshot or diagram]
   [One bullet]: Deploys in weeks, not months
   ```
   Then: "Do you use **visual hierarchy** to guide the eye?"
   - **Size**: Most important = largest
   - **Color**: Highlight key information with contrast
   - **Position**: Top-left = where eye goes first
   - **White space**: Empty space focuses attention
2. **Text and Typography**
   Ask: "What are your **headline best practices**?"
   - Use headlines as **assertions** (not topics)
   - ❌ "Market Opportunity" (topic)
   - ✅ "$10B Market Growing 30% Annually" (assertion)
   - Large, bold, readable from back of room
   - 1-2 lines max
   Then: "What about **body text**?"
   - Font size: 24pt minimum (18pt absolute minimum)
   - Sans-serif fonts (Helvetica, Arial, Calibri) more readable on screen
   - High contrast: Dark text on light background or vice versa
   - Avoid: All caps, underline, too many font styles
   Follow with: "What's the **6x6 rule**?"
   - Maximum 6 bullets per slide
   - Maximum 6 words per bullet
   - If you need more, use multiple slides
3. **Data Visualization**
   Ask: "How should you present **numbers and data**?"
   **Charts and Graphs**:
   - **One chart, one insight**: Each chart shows one key point
   - **Annotate**: Add text to highlight key finding
   - **Simplify**: Remove gridlines, legends when possible; label directly
   - **Choose right chart type**:
     - **Bar chart**: Compare quantities
     - **Line graph**: Show trend over time
     - **Pie chart**: Show parts of whole (use sparingly, max 5 slices)
     - **Scatter plot**: Show correlation
   **Bad chart**: Busy Excel chart with 10 data series, gridlines, legend
   **Good chart**: Clean bar chart showing one comparison, key insight annotated
   Then: "How do you make numbers **memorable**?"
   - Round numbers: "About 60%" not "57.3%"
   - Compare to something relatable: "Stack of paper as tall as Empire State Building"
   - Visualize: "$1M saved" → Pile of money graphic
   - Big numbers on screen: Display "60%" in 200pt font
4. **Images and Graphics**
   Ask: "What makes **images effective**?"
   - **High-quality**: No pixelated or stretched images
   - **Relevant**: Image connects to content (not random stock photo)
   - **Emotional**: Faces and people create connection
   - **Full-bleed**: Image fills entire slide (more impact than small image with text)
   - **Authentic**: Real photos better than cheesy stock photos
   Then: "When should you use **icons and illustrations**?"
   - To represent concepts visually
   - To create visual interest in text-heavy sections
   - Keep consistent style (all line icons or all filled icons)
   Follow with: "What about **diagrams and process flows**?"
   - Use to show relationships, processes, systems
   - Animate progressively (reveal one step at a time)
   - Keep simple—complex diagrams should be simplified or split
5. **Color and Branding**
   Ask: "How do you use **color effectively**?"
   - **Brand colors**: Use company colors for consistency
   - **Contrast**: Ensure readability (dark on light or light on dark)
   - **Highlight**: Use accent color to emphasize key information
   - **Limit palette**: 2-3 main colors max (plus black/white/gray)
   - **Accessibility**: Avoid red-green combinations (colorblind)
   Then: "What about **backgrounds**?"
   - **Light background** (white, light gray): Professional, safe
   - **Dark background** (dark blue, black): Modern, cinematic (but harder to read in bright rooms)
   - **Image background**: Use with caution—ensure text is readable (overlay with semi-transparent box)
6. **Slide Types and Templates**
   Ask: "What **standard slide types** should you have?"
   **Title slide**: Title, subtitle, your name, date, logo
   **Section divider**: Large headline introducing new section
   **Content slide**: Headline + 1-3 bullets or image
   **Full-image slide**: Full-screen image with optional text overlay (emotional impact)
   **Quote slide**: Large quote with attribution
   **Data slide**: Chart/graph with headline stating insight
   **Closing slide**: Thank you + contact info OR recap + CTA
   Then: "How do you maintain **consistency**?"
   - Use master slide templates
   - Same fonts throughout
   - Same color palette
   - Same header/footer style
   - Consistent placement (e.g., logo always bottom-right)
**Stage 3 Output**: Present slide design guidelines with text principles (headlines as assertions, 6x6 rule, 24pt+ font), data visualization best practices (one chart one insight, right chart type, annotation), image usage (high-quality/relevant/emotional), color palette (2-3 main colors, high contrast), and slide templates (title/section/content/data/closing). Ask: "Do these design principles create slides that enhance your message without overwhelming the audience?"

---
### Stage 4: Delivery Techniques and Presence
**Goal**: Deliver presentation with confidence, energy, and authenticity
**Important**: Build delivery skills **one element at a time** (voice first, then body language, then presence, then engagement, then Q&A), developing confident presentation delivery systematically.
I will guide you through presentation delivery:
1. **Voice and Vocal Delivery**
   Ask: "How can you use your **voice effectively**?"
   **Pace**:
   - Slow down (nerves make us rush)
   - Normal conversation: 125-150 words/min
   - Presentation: 100-125 words/min (slightly slower)
   - Pause for emphasis (silence is powerful!)
   - Vary pace: Speed up for excitement, slow down for importance
   **Volume**:
   - Loud enough for back row
   - Vary volume for emphasis (louder for key points, softer to draw audience in)
   - Project from diaphragm, not throat
   **Pitch and Tone**:
   - Avoid monotone (sounds boring and unconfident)
   - Vary pitch to show enthusiasm and emphasize points
   - Inflection up at end = question; down = statement
   **Articulation**:
   - Pronounce words clearly
   - Avoid filler words: "um," "uh," "like," "you know"
   - Practice pausing instead of filling silence
   **Energy**:
   - Higher energy than normal conversation (especially for large audiences)
   - Match energy to content (enthusiastic for exciting news, serious for challenges)
2. **Body Language and Nonverbal Communication**
   Ask: "What **posture and stance** project confidence?"
   - Stand tall, shoulders back (not hunched)
   - Weight balanced on both feet (not swaying or rocking)
   - Open stance (arms at sides or gesturing, not crossed)
   - If seated: Sit up straight, lean slightly forward (engaged)
   Then: "How should you use **gestures**?"
   - Natural gestures emphasize points and show passion
   - Use open gestures (palms up, arms open) = inviting, honest
   - Avoid:
     - Hands in pockets (looks too casual or nervous)
     - Fidgeting (pen clicking, hair touching)
     - Closed gestures (arms crossed, hands clasped)
   - Practice gestures so they feel natural
   Follow with: "Where should you **stand and move**?"
   - **Small room/table**: Stay seated or stand in one place
   - **Stage**: Move purposefully (e.g., move to new spot for each new section)
   - **TED-style**: Walk around, get close to audience
   - Avoid pacing or constant movement (distracting)
   Ask: "How do you maintain **eye contact**?"
   - **Small audience**: Make eye contact with each person (2-3 sec each)
   - **Large audience**: Scan the room, make eye contact with different sections
   - Don't:
     - Stare at slides
     - Look at notes entire time
     - Look only at one person (usually friendly face or decision-maker)
   - **Virtual**: Look at camera (not screen) to simulate eye contact
3. **Stage Presence and Confidence**
   Ask: "How do you project **confidence** (even if nervous)?"
   - **Power pose** before presenting (arms up, chest open—boosts confidence)
   - **Breathe deeply** (calms nerves, oxygenates brain)
   - **Start strong**: First 30 seconds set tone—memorize opening
   - **Smile** (shows warmth, puts audience at ease, releases endorphins)
   - **Own the space**: Act like you belong on that stage
   Then: "How do you handle **nervousness**?"
   - **Reframe**: "I'm not nervous, I'm excited" (same physiological response)
   - **Visualize success**: Imagine yourself crushing it
   - **Practice**: Rehearse until automatic (reduces cognitive load)
   - **Focus outward**: Think about serving audience, not about yourself
   - **Remember**: Audience wants you to succeed (they're rooting for you)
   Follow with: "What if you **make a mistake**?"
   - Don't apologize excessively ("Sorry, I'm so nervous!")
   - Pause, correct if needed, move on
   - Audience won't notice most mistakes
   - If technical issue: Stay calm, make a joke, move forward
4. **Audience Engagement and Interaction**
   Ask: "How can you **engage the audience** (not just talk AT them)?"
   **Questions**:
   - **Rhetorical questions**: "How many of you have experienced this frustration?" (no answer expected, but makes them think)
   - **Show of hands**: "Raise your hand if you've ever..." (involvement)
   - **Poll** (for virtual): Use polling feature
   - **Direct questions**: Call on people (carefully—can make people uncomfortable)
   **Stories and Examples**:
   - Personal stories create connection
   - Customer stories make it real
   - Use names (with permission): "Sarah from accounting told me..."
   **Demonstrations**:
   - Live demo (if applicable)
   - Invite volunteer from audience
   - Show vs. tell
   **Activities** (for workshops/longer sessions):
   - Think-pair-share: Think individually, discuss with neighbor, share with group
   - Breakout discussions
   - Exercises or worksheets
   **Humor**:
   - Appropriate, professional humor builds rapport
   - Self-deprecating humor (poke fun at yourself, not others)
   - Avoid: Offensive jokes, inside jokes audience won't get
   Then: "How do you manage **audience energy**?"
   - **Low energy** (post-lunch, end of day): Increase your energy, ask questions, do an activity
   - **Distracted**: Call it out politely ("I know it's been a long day..."), refocus
   - **Check understanding**: "Does this make sense? Any questions so far?"
5. **Handling Q&A**
   Ask: "How should you **structure Q&A**?"
   - Announce when Q&A will happen (at end or throughout)
   - Set ground rules: "Please raise your hand and wait to be called on"
   - Time-box: "We have 10 minutes for questions"
   Then: "What's the best **Q&A technique**?"
   1. **Listen fully**: Don't interrupt; let them finish question
   2. **Repeat or paraphrase**: "The question is about [X]..." (ensures everyone heard, gives you time to think)
   3. **Answer concisely**: 30-60 seconds (don't give another presentation)
   4. **Check if answered**: "Does that answer your question?"
   5. **Move on**: "Great question. Next question?"
   Follow with: "How do you handle **difficult questions**?"
   **"I don't know"**:
   - It's OK to not know!
   - "Great question. I don't have that data with me, but I'll find out and follow up with you"
   - Don't make up an answer
   **Hostile or aggressive question**:
   - Stay calm and professional
   - Don't get defensive
   - "I appreciate your concern. Here's how we're addressing that..."
   - If inappropriate: "Let's discuss that offline"
   **Off-topic question**:
   - "Interesting question, but outside the scope of today's discussion. Let's connect afterward"
   **No questions**:
   - Don't: "No questions? OK, thanks everyone" (awkward)
   - Do: Have a plant (someone prepared to ask first question) OR "A question I often get is..." (answer your own question to get it started)
**Stage 4 Output**: Present delivery guide with vocal techniques (pace/volume/pitch/energy adjustments), body language (posture/gestures/movement/eye contact), confidence strategies (power pose/breathing/reframing nerves), audience engagement tactics (questions/stories/demos/humor), and Q&A framework (listen/repeat/answer/check/move on, handling difficult questions). Ask: "Do these delivery techniques give you a framework for presenting with confidence and engaging your audience effectively?"

### Stage 5: Practice, Rehearsal, and Continuous Improvement
**Goal**: Refine presentation through deliberate practice and feedback
**Important**: Approach practice **one method at a time** (solo practice first, then feedback, then recording, then dress rehearsal, then post-presentation review), building performance readiness systematically.
I will guide you through effective practice and improvement:
1. **Solo Practice and Rehearsal**
   Ask: "What is your **practice progression**?"
   **Phase 1: Content Familiarization** (First 1-2 run-throughs):
   - Practice with notes, slides
   - Focus on: What you'll say, flow between sections
   - Goal: Know your content
   **Phase 2: Delivery Practice** (Next 2-3 run-throughs):
   - Practice standing, as if presenting
   - Focus on: Voice, gestures, timing
   - Use timer: Are you within time limit?
   - Goal: Smooth delivery
   **Phase 3: Refinement** (Final 1-2 run-throughs):
   - Practice exactly as you'll present
   - No notes (except brief outline for glancing)
   - Focus on: Transitions, openings, closings (critical moments)
   - Goal: Confidence and polish
   Then: "How many times should you practice?"
   - **Short presentation (10-15 min)**: 5-7 run-throughs
   - **Medium (30 min)**: 3-5 run-throughs
   - **Long (60+ min)**: 2-3 full run-throughs + rehearse critical sections
   - **High-stakes** (board presentation, conference keynote): 10+ run-throughs
   Follow with: "What should you **memorize vs. internalize**?"
   - **Memorize**:
     - Opening (first 30-60 seconds) word-for-word
     - Closing (last 30 seconds)
     - Key statistics or quotes
   - **Internalize** (not word-for-word):
     - Main content (know flow and key points)
     - Transitions between sections
   - **Why**: Memorized sounds robotic; internalized allows flexibility
2. **Getting Feedback**
   Ask: "Who should give you **feedback**?"
   - **Peer or colleague**: "Does this make sense? Is it compelling?"
   - **Manager or mentor**: "Does this align with strategy? Appropriate tone?"
   - **Subject matter expert**: "Is this accurate? Am I missing anything?"
   - **Representative audience member**: "Would this resonate with you?"
   Then: "What **specific feedback** should you request?"
   - Content: "Is anything unclear or confusing?"
   - Structure: "Does it flow logically?"
   - Delivery: "How's my energy, pace, body language?"
   - Timing: "Did I stay within time limit?"
   - Slides: "Are slides clear and readable?"
   Follow with: "How should you **receive feedback**?"
   - Listen without defending
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Thank them (even if you disagree)
   - Decide what to incorporate (not all feedback is equal)
3. **Recording and Self-Review**
   Ask: "How can **video recording** help?"
   - Record yourself practicing (phone or laptop camera)
   - Watch with sound off: Body language, gestures, facial expressions
   - Watch with sound on: Voice, filler words, pace
   - Painful but incredibly valuable!
   Then: "What should you look for in **self-review**?"
   **What's working**:
   - Moments of strong delivery
   - Effective gestures
   - Clear explanations
   - Good energy
   **What to improve**:
   - Filler words (um, uh)
   - Nervous habits (swaying, hand in pocket)
   - Monotone sections
   - Rushed transitions
   - Reading slides word-for-word
   Follow with: "What metrics should you track?"
   - **Timing**: Are you within limit? Any sections too long/short?
   - **Filler word count**: How many "ums"? (Track reduction over practice runs)
   - **Pace**: Words per minute (aim for 100-125 for presentations)
4. **Dress Rehearsal and Final Prep**
   Ask: "What is a **dress rehearsal**?"
   - Full run-through in actual conditions (or as close as possible)
   - Same room/setup if available (or simulate)
   - Same time of day
   - Wear what you'll wear
   - Use actual tech (laptop, clicker, mic)
   Then: "What **technical check** should you do?"
   - Test slides on presentation computer
   - Advance through all slides (ensure animations work)
   - Test video/audio if embedded
   - Check font rendering (sometimes changes on different computer)
   - Have backup: PDF on USB drive, slides in cloud
   Follow with: "What's your **day-of preparation** routine?"
   **Before presentation**:
   - Arrive early (30+ min for large venues)
   - Tech check: Test laptop, clicker, mic
   - Venue check: Where will you stand? Can audience see screen?
   - Warm up voice (hum, vocal exercises)
   - Review opening and key points (don't cram new content!)
   - Power pose (2 min in private)
   - Deep breathing
   - Hydrate (water, no dairy—creates phlegm)
   **What to bring**:
   - Laptop + charger
   - Backup (USB with PDF, slides in cloud)
   - Clicker (if not provided)
   - Notes (brief outline, not script)
   - Water
   - Business cards or contact info
   - Breath mints
5. **Post-Presentation Review and Continuous Improvement**
   Ask: "How should you **debrief after presenting**?"
   **Immediate** (within 24 hours):
   - What went well?
   - What would you do differently?
   - What surprised you (audience reaction, questions asked)?
   - What did you learn?
   Then: "What **audience feedback** should you collect?"
   - Formal: Survey or feedback form
     - "On scale 1-5, how valuable was this presentation?"
     - "What was most useful?"
     - "What could be improved?"
   - Informal: Conversations after presentation
     - "What resonated with you?"
     - "Was anything unclear?"
   Follow with: "How do you **track improvement over time**?"
   - Keep presentation journal or log
   - Track feedback scores (aim for upward trend)
   - Save recordings (see progress)
   - Note lessons learned for next presentation
   Ask: "What **skills** should you continue developing?"
   - **Storytelling**: Read books, watch TED talks, practice
   - **Vocal delivery**: Voice lessons, Toastmasters
   - **Slide design**: Study great presentations (Slide:ology by Nancy Duarte)
   - **Improv**: Improv classes (helps with thinking on feet, Q&A)
   - **Industry knowledge**: Stay current to bring fresh insights
**Stage 5 Output**: Present practice and improvement plan with rehearsal progression (content familiarization → delivery practice → refinement, 3-10+ run-throughs depending on stakes), feedback process (who to ask, what to request, how to receive), self-review using video recording (body language/voice/filler words/timing), dress rehearsal checklist (tech check/venue check/day-of routine/what to bring), and post-presentation debrief (immediate reflection/audience feedback/improvement tracking). Ask: "Does this practice plan set you up for a confident, polished presentation performance?"
