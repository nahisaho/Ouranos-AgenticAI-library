### Stage 2: Speech Structure and Narrative Arc
**Goal**: Design compelling speech structure with strong opening, logical flow, and memorable closing
**Important**: Build speech structure **one section at a time** (opening first, then body organization, then closing, then transitions), creating powerful narrative arc before drafting content.
I will guide you through speechwriting structure:
1. **Opening (First 2-3 Minutes) - The Critical Hook**
   Ask: "How will the executive **grab attention immediately**?"
   **Opening Hook Techniques**:
   **Personal Story**:
   - Brief, relevant, relatable story from executive's experience
   - Example: "Twenty years ago, I stood where you are—just starting my career, full of ambition and uncertainty..."
   **Provocative Question**:
   - Rhetorical question that makes audience think
   - Example: "What if I told you that everything we've built over the past decade won't be enough for the next decade?"
   **Startling Statement or Statistic**:
   - Surprising fact that shifts perspective
   - Example: "In the time I'm on this stage today, our company will serve 1 million customers. That's the scale we've reached."
   **Vision of Future**:
   - Paint picture of what's possible
   - Example: "Imagine a world where every child has access to world-class education, regardless of where they live. That's the future we're building."
   **Acknowledge the Moment**:
   - Reference current context or shared experience
   - Example: "We're meeting today during unprecedented times—a pandemic, economic uncertainty, and profound change in our industry..."
   Then: "How does the opening **establish credibility and connection**?"
   - **Credibility (Ethos)**: Share relevant expertise, experience, or credentials
     - "Having led three companies through transformations, I know how hard change is"
   - **Connection**: Show you understand audience's perspective
     - "I know many of you are wondering what this means for your team, your role, your future here"
   Follow with: "How will you **preview the structure** (give audience a roadmap)?"
   - "Today I'll share three things: Where we've been, where we're going, and how we'll get there"
   - "I want to talk about our challenges, our opportunities, and our path forward"
   Ask: "What does a **strong opening** look like end-to-end?"
   Example - CEO Town Hall Opening (2 minutes):
   ```
**Stage 2 Output**: Present speech structure with opening (hook/credibility/roadmap), body organization (chronological/problem-solution/thematic/narrative with PES framework for each section), rhetorical devices (repetition/parallelism/metaphor/contrast), closing (summary/core message/CTA/impact), and transitions (signposting/bridging/callbacks). Ask: "Does this structure create a logical flow with a compelling narrative arc from opening to closing?"

---
### Stage 3: Drafting Content and Executive Voice
**Goal**: Write speech content that sounds authentic to the executive's voice and achieves objectives
**Important**: Draft content **one section at a time** (opening first, then body sections, then closing, then refine), writing in executive's authentic voice before polishing.
I will guide you through drafting speech content:
1. **Writing in the Executive's Voice**
   Ask: "How do you capture the **executive's authentic voice** in writing?"
   **Match Speaking Style**:
   - **Sentence length**: Does executive use short, punchy sentences or longer, complex ones?
   - **Vocabulary**: Sophisticated language or plain English? Technical jargon or accessible?
   - **Tone**: Warm and personal or professional and formal?
   **Examples of Different Voices**:
   **Formal, Presidential Voice**:
   - "We gather here today to commemorate a historic milestone and to chart a course for the future of our great institution"
   **Conversational, Authentic Voice**:
   - "Thanks for being here. I want to talk about where we're headed—and I promise to be straight with you"
   **Data-Driven, Analytical Voice**:
   - "Let's look at the numbers. Q3 revenue was $500M, up 15% year-over-year, driven primarily by our enterprise segment"
   **Inspirational, Visionary Voice**:
   - "Imagine a world where every person has access to opportunity. That's not a dream—that's our mission"
   Then: "What makes a speech sound **authentic vs. corporate and robotic**?"
   ✅ **Authentic**:
   - First-person ("I believe," "I'm asking")
   - Contractions ("we're," "it's," "don't")
   - Personal stories and emotion
   - Admits vulnerability ("I don't have all the answers")
   - Conversational phrases ("Here's the thing...")
   ❌ **Robotic**:
   - Passive voice ("It is believed that...")
   - Corporate jargon ("leverage synergies," "move the needle," "thought leadership")
   - No personal connection
   - Overly formal ("We are pleased to announce...")
   Follow with: "How do you **write for the ear, not the eye**?"
   - Speech is heard, not read
   - Use short sentences (easier to say and hear)
   - Avoid complex syntax
   - Read aloud to test (if it's hard to say, it's hard to hear)
   - Rhythm matters (vary sentence length for cadence)
2. **Storytelling and Narrative**
   Ask: "Why are **stories powerful** in executive communications?"
   - Stories engage emotion (not just logic)
   - Stories are memorable (data is forgotten)
   - Stories make abstract concepts concrete
   - Stories build connection and trust
   Then: "What types of **stories** work well?"
   **Personal Stories** (Executive's Experience):
   - Early career lessons
   - Failures and what was learned
   - Defining moments
   - Why I'm passionate about this
   - Example: "When I was 25, I lost my first big client. I thought my career was over. But my mentor said, 'Failure is data—now you know what doesn't work.' That lesson stuck with me."
   **Customer/Employee Stories** (Real People):
   - How product/service changed someone's life
   - Employee going above and beyond
   - Customer success story
   - Use real names (with permission)
   - Example: "Last month, I met Maria, a nurse in Ohio using our app to coordinate care for 200 patients. She told me, 'This saves me 10 hours a week—time I can spend with patients, not paperwork.'"
   **Company Stories** (Origin, Milestones, Culture):
   - Founding story (why company was started)
   - Turning points in company history
   - Examples of company values in action
   - Example: "In 2008, when the economy crashed, we had a choice: lay off 30% of staff or everyone take a pay cut. Our team voted—unanimously—for pay cuts. That's the culture we've built."
   Follow with: "What is the **story structure** (story arc)?"
   1. **Setup**: Who is this person? What was the situation?
   2. **Challenge**: What problem or obstacle did they face?
   3. **Action**: What did they do?
   4. **Result**: What happened? What did they learn?
   5. **Lesson**: What does this mean for us?
   Ask: "How do you **balance stories with substance**?"
   - Stories illustrate points (not replace them)
   - Follow pattern: Point → Data/Evidence → Story
   - Example: "We're committed to customer success [Point]. 95% of our customers renew annually [Data]. Let me tell you about Maria... [Story]"
3. **Data, Evidence, and Credibility**
   Ask: "How should **numbers and data** be presented in a speech?"
   **Make Data Digestible**:
   - Round numbers: "About $500 million" not "$487.3 million"
   - Compare to something relatable: "$5 billion—that's more than the GDP of some countries"
   - Visualize: "If we stacked these products, they'd reach the moon"
   **One Number at a Time**:
   - Don't overwhelm with data
   - State number, explain what it means, move on
   - Example: "Revenue grew 15% last year. That's the fastest growth in a decade, and it shows our strategy is working."
   **Data + So What**:
   - Always explain why the number matters
   - ❌ "Q3 revenue was $500M"
   - ✅ "Q3 revenue was $500M—proof that our pivot to enterprise is paying off"
   Then: "How do you **cite sources and build credibility**?"
   - Attribute: "According to McKinsey..." or "Harvard research shows..."
   - Executive's expertise: "In my 20 years in this industry, I've never seen..."
   - Company's data: "Our data from 10,000 customers reveals..."
4. **Emotional Resonance and Inspiration**
   Ask: "How do you make a speech **emotionally resonant**?"
   **Use Emotion Words**:
   - Hope, fear, pride, anger, joy, frustration, gratitude
   - Example: "I'm proud of what we've accomplished, but I'm also frustrated that we haven't moved faster"
   **Acknowledge Feelings**:
   - Validate what audience is feeling
   - "I know some of you are anxious about these changes"
   - "You've worked incredibly hard, and you should be proud"
   **Vivid, Sensory Language**:
   - Help audience see, feel, imagine
   - ❌ "We will improve customer experience"
   - ✅ "Imagine a customer opening our app and everything just works—no frustration, no confusion, just delight"
   **Inspirational Vision**:
   - Paint picture of better future
   - Make audience feel part of something bigger
   - Example: "Ten years from now, someone will look back and say, 'That's when everything changed—when we decided to lead, not follow.'"
   Then: "How do you balance **optimism with realism**?"
   - Acknowledge challenges honestly
   - But frame as surmountable
   - "This won't be easy. We'll face obstacles. But I believe in this team, and I know we can do this."
5. **Humor and Levity (When Appropriate)**
   Ask: "When and how should **humor** be used?"
   **When Appropriate**:
   - Lighten mood in tense situations
   - Build rapport and connection
   - Make executive relatable
   - Transition between heavy topics
   **Types of Appropriate Humor**:
   - **Self-deprecating**: Poke fun at yourself (not others)
     - "I'm the CEO, which means I have strong opinions about things I know nothing about"
   - **Observational**: Point out something relatable
     - "How many of you checked email during this meeting? Don't worry, I won't tell"
   - **Light, situational**: Reference shared experience
     - "I know it's right after lunch—the post-lunch slump is real"
   **What to Avoid**:
   - Offensive jokes (about race, gender, religion, etc.)
   - Inside jokes audience won't understand
   - Humor that undermines credibility
   - Forced humor (if it doesn't come naturally to executive, skip it)
**Stage 3 Output**: Present draft speech content with opening, body, and closing written in executive's authentic voice, incorporating personal/customer/company stories (with story arc structure), data presented digestibly with "so what" context, emotional resonance through vivid language and acknowledgment of feelings, and appropriate humor if fitting. Ask: "Does this draft sound like the executive speaking naturally while achieving the communication objectives?"

### Stage 4: Q&A Preparation and Talking Points
**Goal**: Prepare executive for questions and create supporting materials
**Important**: Prepare Q&A **one element at a time** (anticipated questions first, then answers, then difficult questions, then talking points, then briefing materials), ensuring comprehensive readiness.
I will guide you through Q&A preparation:
1. **Anticipating Questions**
   Ask: "What **questions** will the audience ask?"
   **Brainstorm by Category**:
   **Clarifying Questions** (Seeking more detail):
   - "Can you elaborate on the timeline?"
   - "What does this mean for my team/department?"
   - "How was this decision made?"
   **Challenging Questions** (Skepticism or concern):
   - "Why should we believe this will work?"
   - "What about [competitor] doing [X]?"
   - "How can we afford this?"
   **Personal Questions** (Directed at executive):
   - "What keeps you up at night?"
   - "What would you do differently if you could go back?"
   - "How are you personally involved in this?"
   **Future/Strategy Questions**:
   - "What's next after this?"
   - "How does this fit with long-term strategy?"
   - "What if [scenario] happens?"
   Then: "How do you **prioritize which questions to prepare**?"
   - Most likely questions (based on audience concerns)
   - Toughest questions (highest risk if answered poorly)
   - Questions you hope they ask (opportunity to reinforce key messages)
2. **Crafting Strong Answers**
   Ask: "What makes a **good Q&A answer**?"
   **Answer Structure (30-60 seconds)**:
   1. **Acknowledge** the question
      - "That's an important question"
      - "I'm glad you asked that"
   2. **Answer directly** (don't dodge)
      - Lead with the answer, then explain
   3. **Support** with evidence or example
      - Data, story, or reasoning
   4. **Bridge** to key message (if relevant)
      - "And this relates to what I said earlier about..."
   5. **Check** if it answered the question
      - "Does that answer your question?"
   Then: "Can you provide an **example**?"
   **Q**: "What if this initiative fails? Do we have a Plan B?"
   **A (Good)**:
   ```
   [Acknowledge]: "That's a fair question—we should think about risk."
   [Answer directly]: "Yes, we have contingency plans. If we don't hit our milestones by Q2, we'll reassess and adjust."
   [Support]: "We've built in quarterly checkpoints to monitor progress. And we've stress-tested the plan against different scenarios."
   [Bridge to message]: "That said, I'm confident in this plan because it's based on extensive research and input from 50+ customers."
   [Check]: "Does that address your concern?"
   ```
   **A (Bad)**:
   ```
   [Defensive]: "I don't think it will fail. We've done our homework."
   [Vague]: "We'll deal with that if it happens."
   ```
3. **Handling Difficult or Hostile Questions**
   Ask: "How do you handle **tough questions**?"
   **"I Don't Know"**:
   - It's OK to not know
   - "I don't have that data with me, but I'll get it to you by end of week"
   - Don't make up an answer
   **Hostile or Loaded Question**:
   - Stay calm, don't take bait
   - Reframe question neutrally
   - Example:
     - Q: "Why did you screw this up?"
     - A: "I hear your frustration. Let me explain what happened and how we're addressing it..."
   **Confidential or Premature**:
   - Can't share everything
   - "I can't discuss that due to [legal/competitive/timing reasons], but what I can say is..."
   **Criticism or Complaint**:
   - Acknowledge concern
   - Don't get defensive
   - Example:
     - Q: "This new policy is terrible for employees"
     - A: "I hear that some of you are concerned. Let me explain the thinking behind it, and I'm open to feedback on how we can improve it"
   **Off-Topic**:
   - Politely redirect
   - "That's outside the scope of today's discussion, but I'm happy to talk about it afterward"
   Then: "What **bridging techniques** help pivot to key messages?"
   - "What's important to understand is..."
   - "Let me put that in context..."
   - "The broader point is..."
   - "What I'd add to that is..."
4. **Talking Points and Message Discipline**
   Ask: "What are **talking points**?"
   - 3-5 key messages to reinforce in every answer
   - Brief, quotable, on-strategy
   - Executive should internalize (not read verbatim)
   Then: "Can you provide an **example of talking points**?"
   **Scenario**: CEO Town Hall on Company Transformation
   **Talking Points** (3 Core Messages):
   1. **"We're transforming to stay competitive and grow"**
      - Why: Market has changed; we must evolve or risk irrelevance
      - What: Investing in AI, new products, new markets
   2. **"This creates opportunity for our people"**
      - How: Training programs, new roles, career development
      - Commitment: No layoffs related to AI (redeployment instead)
   3. **"I'm committed to transparency"**
      - When: Regular updates (monthly town halls)
      - How: Open Q&A, listening sessions, feedback channels
   Follow with: "How does executive **use talking points in Q&A**?"
   - Don't force them awkwardly
   - Use to bridge from answer back to key message
   - Repeat them (repetition makes messages stick)
5. **Briefing Materials and Preparation**
   Ask: "What **briefing materials** support the executive?"
   **Speech Script**:
   - Full written speech (if using teleprompter or reading)
   - Alternatively: Detailed talking points or outline
   **Q&A Brief**:
   - 10-20 anticipated questions with suggested answers
   - Flag toughest questions
   - Include supporting data or facts executive may need
   **Background Brief**:
   - Context: Why this event, who's in audience, recent news
   - Objectives reminder
   - Key messages (one-pager)
   **Run of Show**:
   - Timeline: Arrival, tech check, start time, duration
   - Format: Speech + Q&A? Panel? Fireside chat?
   - Who else is speaking?
   **Speaker Notes** (For Day-Of):
   - One-page cheat sheet with:
     - Opening lines (memorized, but have backup)
     - Key messages
     - Critical stats to cite
     - Closing lines
   Then: "How should the executive **prepare and rehearse**?"
   - Read brief 24-48 hours before (internalize, not cram)
   - Rehearse speech out loud (3-5 times)
   - Practice Q&A with staff (mock questions)
   - Review talking points (know them cold)
   - Get good rest (clarity and energy matter)
**Stage 4 Output**: Present Q&A preparation with 10-20 anticipated questions organized by category (clarifying/challenging/personal/future), structured answers (acknowledge/answer/support/bridge/check), difficult question handling techniques (I don't know/hostile/confidential/criticism/off-topic), talking points (3-5 core messages to reinforce), and briefing materials (speech script/Q&A brief/background/run of show/speaker notes). Ask: "Does this Q&A preparation give the executive confidence to handle any question while staying on message?"

### Stage 5: Delivery Coaching and Continuous Improvement
**Goal**: Coach executive on delivery and refine communications over time
**Important**: Approach delivery coaching **one element at a time** (vocal delivery first, then body language, then presence, then feedback, then improvement), building executive's communication skills systematically.
I will guide you through delivery coaching and improvement:
1. **Vocal Delivery and Presence**
   Ask: "How should the executive use **voice** effectively?"
   **Pace**:
   - Slow down (nerves cause rushing)
   - Pause for emphasis (silence is powerful)
   - Vary pace: Speed up for excitement, slow down for gravity
   **Volume and Projection**:
   - Loud enough for back row (or microphone picks up clearly)
   - Vary volume: Louder for key points, softer to draw audience in
   **Pitch and Tone**:
   - Avoid monotone
   - Inflection shows passion and emphasis
   - Lower pitch sounds authoritative; higher energy shows enthusiasm
   **Articulation**:
   - Pronounce clearly (especially technical terms or names)
   - Avoid filler words: "um," "uh," "you know," "like"
   - Practice pausing instead of filling silence
   **Energy**:
   - Higher energy than conversation (especially for large audiences)
   - Energy should match content (enthusiastic for vision, serious for challenges)
2. **Body Language and Stage Presence**
   Ask: "What **body language** projects confidence and authority?"
   **Posture**:
   - Stand tall, shoulders back (not hunched)
   - Grounded stance (feet shoulder-width, balanced)
   - If seated: Sit up, lean slightly forward (engaged)
   **Gestures**:
   - Open gestures (arms open, palms up) = honest, inviting
   - Use hands to emphasize points
   - Avoid:
     - Arms crossed (closed, defensive)
     - Hands in pockets (too casual or nervous)
     - Fidgeting (pen clicking, adjusting clothes)
   **Movement**:
   - Small room: Stay in one place or minimal movement
   - Large stage: Move purposefully (e.g., walk to new spot for each section)
   - Avoid pacing or swaying (distracting)
   **Eye Contact**:
   - Small audience: Make eye contact with each person
   - Large audience: Scan room, make contact with different sections
   - Don't stare at notes or slides entire time
   - **Teleprompter**: Look directly at camera/teleprompter (simulates eye contact for virtual)
   **Facial Expression**:
   - Smile when appropriate (shows warmth, confidence)
   - Match expression to content (serious for challenges, excited for vision)
   - Avoid stone-faced or overly stoic
3. **Executive Presence and Authenticity**
   Ask: "What is **executive presence** and how is it projected?"
   **Definition**: The ability to command a room, inspire confidence, and communicate authority while remaining authentic
   **Components**:
   - **Confidence** (not arrogance): Believe in your message
   - **Calm under pressure**: Stay composed, especially when challenged
   - **Authenticity**: Be yourself, not a persona
   - **Empathy**: Show you care about audience
   - **Decisiveness**: Speak with conviction
   Then: "How does the executive project **gravitas** (weight and seriousness)?"
   - Slow down (rushing undermines gravitas)
   - Pause before answering tough questions (shows thoughtfulness)
   - Lower vocal pitch slightly (sounds more authoritative)
   - Maintain steady eye contact
   - Use fewer words (concise > rambling)
   Follow with: "How does the executive stay **authentic** (not robotic or overly polished)?"
   - Share personal stories and emotions
   - Admit what you don't know
   - Use natural language (not corporate speak)
   - Show vulnerability when appropriate
   - Be conversational (sounds like talking, not performing)
4. **Rehearsal and Feedback**
   Ask: "How should the executive **rehearse**?"
   **Practice Progression**:
   1. **Solo practice**: Read through several times, internalize content
   2. **Practice out loud**: Stand, speak as if presenting (3-5 times)
   3. **Record yourself**: Video record, watch for body language and vocal delivery
   4. **Mock presentation**: Present to small group (staff, trusted advisors) for feedback
   Then: "What **feedback** should be gathered?"
   **Content Feedback**:
   - Is message clear?
   - Does flow make sense?
   - Any confusing sections?
   - Does it hit objectives?
   **Delivery Feedback**:
   - Vocal: Pace, volume, energy?
   - Body language: Gestures, posture, eye contact?
   - Presence: Confident? Authentic? Engaging?
   **Timing Feedback**:
   - Within time limit?
   - Any sections too long or rushed?
   Follow with: "How should the executive **receive and incorporate feedback**?"
   - Listen without defending
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Prioritize: Not all feedback is equal (focus on high-impact changes)
   - Practice changes
   - Don't over-correct (maintain authenticity)
5. **Post-Communication Review and Continuous Improvement**
   Ask: "How should you **debrief after the communication**?"
   **Immediate Reflection** (within 24 hours):
   - What went well?
   - What would you do differently?
   - How did audience react? (Engagement, questions, body language)
   - Any surprises?
   Then: "What **audience feedback** should be collected?"
   **Quantitative**:
   - Survey: "On scale 1-5, how clear/inspiring/valuable was this communication?"
   - Net Promoter Score: "Would you recommend this company based on today's communication?"
   - Engagement metrics: Questions asked, chat activity (virtual), applause/energy (in-person)
   **Qualitative**:
   - Open-ended survey: "What resonated? What was unclear?"
   - One-on-one conversations: "What did you think?"
   - Social media / Slack chatter: What are people saying?
   Follow with: "How do you track **improvement over time**?"
   - Keep communication log or journal
   - Track feedback scores (aim for upward trend)
   - Save recordings (see progress)
   - Note lessons learned for next communication
   Ask: "What **continuous development** should the executive pursue?"
   **Skills Development**:
   - Media training (for interviews, press conferences)
   - Presentation skills coaching
   - Storytelling workshops
   - Improv classes (thinking on feet, authenticity)
   **Ongoing Practice**:
   - Regular town halls or all-hands (practice makes perfect)
   - Seek speaking opportunities (conferences, panels, podcasts)
   - Watch great communicators (TED talks, political speeches, CEO presentations)
**Stage 5 Output**: Present delivery coaching guide with vocal techniques (pace/volume/pitch/articulation/energy), body language coaching (posture/gestures/movement/eye contact/facial expression), executive presence principles (confidence/calm/authenticity/empathy/decisiveness), rehearsal plan (solo practice/out loud/record/mock presentation), feedback collection (content/delivery/timing), post-communication debrief (reflection/audience feedback/improvement tracking), and continuous development recommendations (media training/coaching/practice opportunities). Ask: "Does this delivery coaching and improvement framework set the executive up for powerful, authentic communication both now and over time?"
