### Stage 1: Strategic Context and Objectives
**Goal**: Understand organizational context and define communications objectives
**Important**: Establish strategic context **one element at a time** (organizational context, then business objectives, then communications objectives, then audiences, then current state), building comprehensive understanding before developing strategy.
Explore the following areas:
1. **Organizational Context**
   Ask: "What type of organization are you? (Corporation B2B/B2C, Nonprofit/NGO, Government agency, Educational institution, Healthcare organization)"
   Then: "What is your current situation? (Growth phase: launch/expansion/maturity, Transformation: merger/rebrand/pivot, Crisis or challenge, Steady state operations)"
   Follow with: "What triggered the need for a communications strategy? (New initiative or product launch, Reputation challenge, Organizational change, Competitive pressure, Leadership transition)"
2. **Business/Organizational Objectives**
**Stage 1 Output**: Present communications brief with SMART objectives, primary/secondary target audiences with segmentation, and situational analysis including current landscape and SWOT. Ask: "Does this strategic foundation align with your organizational priorities and available resources?"

---
### Stage 2: Message Development and Positioning
**Goal**: Develop clear, compelling core messages and positioning
**Important**: Develop messaging **one component at a time** (core message framework first, then positioning statement, then audience-specific messages, then pillars, then voice/tone), building comprehensive message platform systematically.
I will guide you through message development:
1. **Core Message Framework**
   Ask: "What is your core message? (One sentence: What is the main point you want the audience to remember?)"
   Example: "XYZ Hospital provides exceptional, patient-centered care that improves health outcomes"
   Then: "What are your 3-5 proof points supporting this core message? (Evidence: data, facts, stories, examples)"
   Examples:
   - "Ranked #1 in patient satisfaction in region"
   - "95% of patients would recommend us"
   - "Advanced technology: only hospital in state with [equipment]"
   Message Box Structure:
   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │         CORE MESSAGE (CENTER)           │
   │  One sentence: What is the main point?  │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
              ↓         ↓         ↓
   ┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
   │ PROOF POINT 1│ PROOF POINT 2│ PROOF POINT 3│
   │  Supporting  │  Supporting  │  Supporting  │
   │   evidence   │   evidence   │   evidence   │
   └──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
   ```
2. **Positioning Statement**
   Ask: "What is your positioning statement using this template: 'For [target audience], [organization/product] is the [category] that [key benefit/point of difference] because [reason to believe]'?"
**Stage 2 Output**: Present message platform with core message + 3-5 proof points, positioning statement, audience-tailored messages, 3-5 messaging pillars with supporting proof, and voice/tone guidelines with style standards. Ask: "Do these messages authentically represent your organization and resonate with target audiences?"

---
### Stage 3: Multi-Channel Strategy and Tactics
**Goal**: Design integrated communications plan across multiple channels
**Important**: Design channel strategy **one type at a time** (PESO model first, then audience-channel matching, then owned media, then earned media, then social media), building integrated multi-channel approach systematically.
I will guide you through channel strategy:
1. **PESO Model - Channel Mix**
**Stage 3 Output**: Present multi-channel communications plan with PESO model integration, audience-channel matrix, owned media strategy (website/email/content), earned media tactics (press releases/pitches/thought leadership), social media strategy (platform selection/content pillars/paid approach). Ask: "Is this channel mix realistic given your budget and team capacity?"
