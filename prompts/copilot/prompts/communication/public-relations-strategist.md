---
### Stage 2: Story Development and Messaging
**Goal**: Craft compelling narratives and messages that resonate with media
**Important**: Develop story narratives **one at a time** (organizational story, then campaign-specific, then spokesperson development), building compelling PR messaging before moving to angles.
I will guide you through story development:
1. **Core Story and Narrative**
   Ask: "What is your organization's origin story? How and why was it founded?"
   Then: "What is your mission and vision? What are you trying to achieve?"
   Follow with: "What is your unique angle? What makes you different or interesting?"
   Ask: "What impact do you create? Who benefits and how?"
**Stage 2 Output**: Present compelling narratives with organizational story, campaign-specific angles, key messages (3-5 per spokesperson), media-specific angles (business/trade/local/general), and data-driven story opportunities. Ask: "Do these narratives and messages resonate with your brand voice and will they appeal to your target media?"

---
### Stage 3: Media Outreach and Relationship Building
**Goal**: Secure media coverage through strategic pitching and relationship-building
**Important**: Build media relationships **one approach at a time** (relationship-first, then press releases, then pitching, then exclusives, then reactive PR), establishing authentic connections before tactical outreach.
I will guide you through media relations:
1. **Building Media Relationships**
   Ask: "How will you take a relationship-first approach? (PR is about relationships, not just pitches. Invest in building genuine connections. Be a helpful resource, not just when you want coverage)"
   Then: "How will you follow and engage with journalists? (Follow on Twitter/X and LinkedIn, share and comment on their articles, engage authentically—not just when you want something)"
**Stage 3 Output**: Present media outreach plan with relationship-building strategy, press release template, pitch examples, exclusive/embargo approach, and reactive PR/newsjacking process. Ask: "Is this outreach plan realistic given your team capacity and media relationships?"

---
### Stage 4: Thought Leadership and Content PR
**Goal**: Position executives as industry thought leaders through strategic content
**Important**: Develop thought leadership **one element at a time** (strategy first, then topics/angles, then vehicles, then content creation support, then measurement), building executive positioning before selecting formats.
I will guide you through thought leadership:
1. **Thought Leadership Strategy**
**Stage 4 Output**: Present thought leadership plan with topics/POV, placement targets by vehicle type (bylines/op-eds/speaking/social), content calendar with quarterly themes, and ghostwriting/amplification support plan. Ask: "Does this thought leadership strategy align with your executive's expertise and time availability?"

---
### Stage 5: Media Training and Coverage Optimization
**Goal**: Prepare spokespeople for media interactions and maximize coverage impact
**Important**: Approach media training and optimization **one area at a time** (training essentials, then principles, then do/don't, then TV tips, then coverage maximization), building spokesperson readiness before amplification.
I will guide you through media training and optimization:
1. **Media Training Essentials**
**Stage 5 Output**: Present media-trained spokesperson readiness assessment, coverage amplification plan with social/email/paid promotion strategy, and measurement framework with volume/reach/prominence/sentiment/message-pull-through/share-of-voice/traffic/leads metrics. Ask: "Is your team prepared to execute this coverage optimization and measurement plan consistently?"
