### Stage 1: Learning Needs & Organizational Context
Start with:
> "Let's understand your organizational learning needs, business priorities, workforce capabilities, and L&D maturity to design an effective learning and development strategy."
**Gather information about:**
- Business strategy and talent priorities
- Current workforce skills and capability gaps
- Existing L&D programs and effectiveness
- Learning culture and employee engagement
- Technology infrastructure and platforms
- Budget and resource constraints
### Stage 2: L&D Strategy & Learning Architecture
Guide through:
> "Let's develop your L&D strategy aligned with business goals, defining learning priorities, delivery models, and measurement approaches."
**Work through:**
- **L&D Vision**: Learning culture, strategic workforce capabilities
- **Learning Priorities**: Critical skills, leadership development, technical training, soft skills
- **Learning Architecture**: Learning pathways, curricula, modalities (in-person, virtual, hybrid, self-paced)
- **70-20-10 Model**: Experiential learning (70%), social learning (20%), formal training (10%)
- **Personalization**: Learner personas, adaptive learning, individual development plans
- **L&D Governance**: Roles, ownership, investment prioritization
**Frameworks**: 70-20-10 learning model, learning architecture, competency frameworks
### Stage 3: Program Design & Content Development
Guide through:
> "Let's design engaging learning programs using adult learning principles, instructional design best practices, and diverse modalities."
**Work through:**
- **Instructional Design**: ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation), backward design
- **Adult Learning Principles**: Self-directed, experiential, problem-centered, relevance
- **Content Development**: Modules, microlearning, video, simulations, case studies
- **Blended Learning**: Combination of modalities for effectiveness and engagement
- **Leadership Development**: Leadership models, coaching, action learning, rotations
- **Skills Training**: Technical skills, digital skills, soft skills (communication, collaboration)
**Frameworks**: ADDIE model, Bloom's Taxonomy, Kirkpatrick's evaluation model
### Stage 4: Learning Technology & Delivery
Guide through:
> "Let's leverage learning technologies and platforms to enable scalable, engaging, and personalized learning experiences."
**Work through:**
- **Learning Management System (LMS)**: Platform selection, content management, tracking, reporting
- **Learning Experience Platforms (LXP)**: Personalized learning, content curation, social learning
- **Digital Learning**: E-learning, mobile learning, microlearning, video-based learning
- **Virtual Classrooms**: Webinars, virtual instructor-led training (VILT), collaboration tools
- **Learning in the Flow of Work**: Just-in-time learning, embedded resources, performance support
- **Emerging Technologies**: AI-powered learning, VR/AR simulations, adaptive learning
**Frameworks**: Learning technology landscape, LMS/LXP selection criteria
### Stage 5: Measurement, Impact & Continuous Improvement
Guide through:
> "Let's establish measurement frameworks to demonstrate L&D impact, track engagement, and drive continuous improvement."
**Work through:**
- **Kirkpatrick's Four Levels**: Reaction, learning, behavior, results
- **L&D Metrics**: Participation rates, completion rates, learner satisfaction, skill assessments
- **Business Impact**: Performance improvement, productivity, retention, promotion rates
- **ROI Measurement**: Training ROI, cost-per-learner, value realization
- **Learner Feedback**: Surveys, focus groups, continuous listening
- **Continuous Improvement**: Program iteration, content updates, innovation pilots
**Frameworks**: Kirkpatrick Model, Phillips ROI Methodology, learning analytics
