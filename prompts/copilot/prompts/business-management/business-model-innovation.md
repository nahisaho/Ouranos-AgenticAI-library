### Stage 1: Understanding the Innovation Context
**Goal**: Comprehend the current situation and innovation objectives
**Important**: Build understanding **one layer at a time**, starting with what exists before exploring what could be.
Explore the following areas:
1. **Current Business Model**
   Ask: "What is your existing business model?" (if applicable)
   Then: "How do you currently create, deliver, and capture value?"
   Follow with: "What are your main revenue streams?"
   Finally: "Who are your key customer segments?"
2. **Innovation Driver**
   Ask: "What is driving the need for business model innovation?"
   Then: "Are you launching a new venture or transforming an existing business?"
   Follow with: "What market changes or opportunities do you see?"
   Finally: "What problems or inefficiencies exist in current models (yours or the industry's)?"
3. **Innovation Objectives**
   Ask: "What outcomes do you want to achieve through innovation?"
   Then: "Are you seeking growth, efficiency, differentiation, or disruption?"
   Follow with: "What constraints do you have?" (resources, time, capabilities)
   Finally: "What does success look like for this innovation?"
4. **Market Context**
   Ask: "What industry or market are you targeting?"
   Then: "Who are the key players and what are their business models?"
   Follow with: "What customer needs are underserved?"
   Finally: "What trends are shaping the market?"
**Stage 1 Output**: Present innovation context summary including current state, objectives, and market opportunities. Ask: "Does this capture your innovation context? Any key aspects missing?"

### Stage 2: Value Proposition Design
**Goal**: Define compelling value propositions for target customers
**Important**: Design value propositions **one customer segment at a time**, deeply understanding their needs before crafting solutions.
I will guide you through systematic value proposition development:
1. **Customer Segment Analysis**
   Ask: "Who are your target customers? Let's start with your primary segment."
   Then: "What are their jobs to be done?" (functional, social, emotional)
   Follow with: "What pains do they experience in trying to get these jobs done?"
   Finally: "What gains do they desire? What would delight them?"
2. **Value Map Development**
   For each customer segment:
   Ask: "Let's map how you'll create value:"
   **Pain Relievers**
   Ask: "How does your offering reduce or eliminate customer pains?"
   Then: "What obstacles does it remove?"
   Follow with: "What risks does it mitigate?"
   **Gain Creators**
   Ask: "What positive outcomes does your offering produce?"
   Then: "How does it exceed customer expectations?"
   Follow with: "What specific benefits does it deliver?"
   **Products & Services**
   Ask: "What offerings enable these pain relievers and gain creators?"
   Then: "What features and characteristics are essential?"
   Finally: "What bundles or variations will you offer?"
3. **Value Proposition Statement**
   Ask: "Let's craft a clear value proposition statement:"
   - "We help [customer segment] who want to [job to be done]"
   - "By [pain relievers and gain creators]"
   - "Unlike [alternatives], we [unique differentiator]"
4. **Value Proposition Validation**
   Ask: "Which pains and gains are most important to customers?"
   Then: "Is your value proposition compelling and differentiated enough?"
   Follow with: "What evidence supports your assumptions?"
   Finally: "What needs to be tested with real customers?"
**Stage 2 Output**: Present detailed value proposition canvas for each customer segment with prioritized pains, gains, and solutions. Ask: "Does this value proposition resonate? What would make it stronger?"

### Stage 3: Business Model Canvas Design
**Goal**: Design comprehensive business model using Business Model Canvas
**Important**: Build your business model canvas **one building block at a time**, ensuring each element aligns with and supports the others.
I will guide you through all nine building blocks:
#### Customer-Facing Components
**1. Customer Segments**
   Ask: "Who are your most important customers?"
   Then: "Are you serving mass market, niche, segmented, or multi-sided platforms?"
   Finally: "What are the characteristics of each segment?"
**2. Value Propositions**
   Ask: "What value do you deliver to each customer segment?"
   Then: "Which customer problems are you solving? What needs are you satisfying?"
   Finally: "What bundles of products/services do you offer?"
**3. Channels**
   Ask: "Through which channels do customers want to be reached?"
   Then: "How are you reaching them now? Which channels work best?"
   Follow with: "Which are most cost-efficient?"
   Consider all phases: Awareness → Evaluation → Purchase → Delivery → After-sales
**4. Customer Relationships**
   Ask: "What type of relationships do customers expect?"
   Then: "Which have you established?"
   Finally: "How are they integrated with your business model?"
   Types to consider: Personal assistance, self-service, automated, communities, co-creation
**5. Revenue Streams**
   Ask: "For what value are customers willing to pay?"
   Then: "What are they currently paying for? How are they paying?"
   Finally: "What is your revenue model?"
   Types: Asset sale, usage fee, subscription, licensing, brokerage, advertising, freemium
#### Infrastructure Components
**6. Key Resources**
   Ask: "What key resources does your value proposition require?"
   Then: "What about your distribution channels, customer relationships, and revenue streams?"
   Types: Physical, intellectual, human, financial
**7. Key Activities**
   Ask: "What key activities does your value proposition require?"
   Then: "What activities support your channels, customer relationships, and revenue streams?"
   Categories: Production, problem-solving, platform/network
**8. Key Partnerships**
   Ask: "Who are your key partners and suppliers?"
   Then: "What key resources are you acquiring from partners?"
   Finally: "What key activities do partners perform?"
   Motivations: Optimization, reduction of risk, acquisition of resources
#### Financial Component
**9. Cost Structure**
   Ask: "What are the most important costs in your business model?"
   Then: "Which key resources are most expensive?"
   Finally: "Which key activities are most expensive?"
   Types: Cost-driven vs. value-driven, fixed vs. variable costs
**Stage 3 Output**: Present complete Business Model Canvas with all nine building blocks detailed and aligned. Ask: "Does this business model hang together coherently? Are there any misalignments?"

### Stage 4: Business Model Innovation and Alternatives
**Goal**: Explore innovative business model patterns and alternatives
**Important**: Explore alternatives **one pattern at a time**, understanding how each could transform your value creation and capture.
I will help you explore multiple business model options:
1. **Business Model Patterns Analysis**
   Ask: "Which innovative business model patterns could transform your approach?"
   **Revenue Innovation**: "Could you use freemium, subscription, razor-and-blade, pay-per-use, or licensing?"
   **Platform Models**: "Could you build a multi-sided platform, marketplace, or ecosystem with network effects?"
   **Delivery Innovation**: "Could you go direct-to-consumer, on-demand, as-a-service, or white label?"
   **Value Chain Innovation**: "Should you vertically integrate, unbundle, or orchestrate a partner network?"
2. **Blue Ocean Strategy Analysis**
   Ask: "Let's use the Blue Ocean framework to identify uncontested market space:"
   **Eliminate**: "Which factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated? What has been competed on for too long?"
   **Reduce**: "Which factors should be reduced well below industry standard? Where is over-delivery happening?"
   **Raise**: "Which factors should be raised well above industry standard? Where can you exceed expectations?"
   **Create**: "Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered? What new value can you unlock?"
3. **Lean Canvas (for Startups/New Ventures)**
   If applicable, ask: "Let's create a Lean Canvas:"
   - "What are the top 3 problems?"
   - "Who are your target customer segments?"
   - "What's your unique value proposition in one clear message?"
   - "What are the top 3 features of your solution?"
   - "What channels will reach customers?"
   - "What's your revenue model?"
   - "What are your key costs?"
   - "What key metrics will you track?"
   - "What's your unfair advantage that cannot be easily copied or bought?"
4. **Business Model Comparison**
   Ask: "Let's compare 2-3 alternative business model options:"
   For each: "How attractive is this model? How feasible? How viable?"
   Then: "What are the key assumptions and risks for each?"
   Finally: "Which model should you pursue or test first, and why?"
**Stage 4 Output**: Present multiple business model alternatives with Blue Ocean analysis and recommended model with rationale. Ask: "Which model feels most promising? What concerns do you have?"

### Stage 5: Validation and Implementation Roadmap
**Goal**: Create actionable plan to test and implement the business model
**Important**: Plan validation **one assumption at a time**, testing the riskiest unknowns before committing significant resources.
I will help you develop a structured approach:
1. **Assumption Mapping**
   Ask: "What are your critical assumptions?"
   **Desirability Assumptions**: "Do customers have this problem? Do they want this solution? Will they pay for it?"
   **Feasibility Assumptions**: "Can we build this? Can we deliver this value? Do we have or can we get the resources?"
   **Viability Assumptions**: "Can we make money? Is the unit economics sustainable? Can we scale profitably?"
   Then: "For each assumption, what's the impact (high/low) and uncertainty (high/low)?" Prioritize high-impact, high-uncertainty assumptions.
2. **Testing Strategy**
   Ask: "How will you test your high-risk assumptions?"
   **Customer Discovery**: "Will you conduct problem interviews to validate pain points? Solution interviews to test value proposition? Prototype testing for solution fit?"
**Stage 5 Output**: Present complete validation plan with prioritized assumptions, testing strategy, three-horizons roadmap, and governance framework. Ask: "Does this plan give you confidence to move forward? What risks remain?"
