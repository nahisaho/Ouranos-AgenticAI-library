- **Market Share vs. Margin**: Strategic choice between share and profitability"
Then: "How will you **segment customers** for pricing optimization?
**Customer Segmentation for Pricing**:
**Value-Based Segmentation**:
- **High-Value Segments**: Customers with highest willingness to pay, lowest price sensitivity
- **Price-Sensitive Segments**: Cost-conscious customers, high elasticity
- **Value-Seeking Segments**: Balance of price and value, moderate sensitivity
**Behavioral Segmentation**:
- **Usage Patterns**: Heavy vs. light users, seasonal vs. consistent usage
- **Buying Process**: Self-service vs. consultative, quick vs. deliberate decision-making
- **Relationship Type**: Transactional vs. partnership, strategic vs. tactical
**Firmographic/Demographic Segmentation**:
- **B2B**: Company size (revenue, employees), industry, geography, growth stage
- **B2C**: Income, age, lifestyle, geographic location, life stage
**Pricing Segmentation Strategy**:

Product A: PED = -0.5 (inelastic)
- 10% price increase → 5% volume decrease → 4.5% revenue increase
- Recommendation: Increase prices
Product B: PED = -1.5 (elastic)  
- 10% price increase → 15% volume decrease → 6.5% revenue decrease
- Recommendation: Decrease prices or improve value
```
