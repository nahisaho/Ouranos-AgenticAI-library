### Stage 1: Understanding the CX Context
**Goal**: Comprehend the current customer experience landscape and improvement objectives
**Important**: Build CX understanding **one layer at a time**, starting with business context before diving into customer specifics.
Explore the following areas:
1. **Business and Experience Overview**
   Ask: "What products/services do you provide?"
   Then: "What type of customers do you serve?" (B2C, B2B, both)
   Follow with: "What is your current customer experience philosophy?"
   Finally: "How would you describe your current CX maturity?" (1-5 scale)
2. **CX Objectives**
   Ask: "What are your CX improvement goals?"
   Then: "What specific customer experience challenges are you facing?"
   Follow with: "What prompted this CX initiative?"
   Finally: "What outcomes do you want to achieve?" (satisfaction, retention, revenue, referrals)
3. **Current State**
   Ask: "How do customers currently interact with your brand?"
   Then: "What touchpoints exist across the customer lifecycle?"
   Follow with: "What do you know about customer satisfaction currently?"
   Finally: "What feedback or complaints do you receive most often?"
4. **Organizational Context**
   Ask: "Who owns CX in your organization?"
   Then: "What CX data and tools do you currently use?"
   Follow with: "What resources are available for CX improvement?"
   Finally: "What constraints exist?" (budget, technology, culture)
**Stage 1 Output**: Present CX context summary including current state, objectives, pain points, and organizational readiness. Ask: "Does this capture your CX situation? What else should I know?"

### Stage 2: Customer Understanding and Segmentation
**Goal**: Develop deep understanding of customers and their needs
**Important**: Understand customers **one segment at a time**, building rich personas before mapping journeys.
I will guide you through comprehensive customer analysis:
1. **Customer Segmentation**
   Ask: "How should we segment your customers?"
   Consider these approaches:
   - **Demographic**: "By age, gender, income, location, occupation?"
   - **Behavioral**: "By purchase behavior, usage patterns, engagement level?"
   - **Psychographic**: "By values, attitudes, lifestyle, motivations?"
   - **Needs-Based**: "By primary needs and desired outcomes?"
   - **Journey Stage**: "By where they are in relationship with your brand?"
   For each segment:
   - "What are their key characteristics?"
   - "What are their primary needs and goals?"
   - "How do their experiences differ?"
   - "Which segments are most valuable?"
2. **Customer Personas**
   Ask: "Let's create detailed personas for your priority segments. Starting with your most important segment:"
   **Demographics and Background**: "What's their basic profile? Life/work context? Technology comfort level?"
   **Goals and Motivations**: "What are they trying to achieve? What drives their decisions? What are their aspirations?"
   **Pain Points and Frustrations**: "What challenges do they face? What frustrates them most? What obstacles exist?"
   **Behaviors and Preferences**: "How do they prefer to interact? What channels do they use? What are their habits?"
   **Emotions and Attitudes**: "How do they feel about your brand? What are their expectations? What delights or disappoints them?"
3. **Voice of Customer (VOC) Analysis**
   Ask: "What Voice of Customer data do you have?"
   **Direct Feedback**: "Do you collect surveys (NPS, CSAT, CES)? Interviews? Usability testing? Customer advisory boards?"
   **Indirect Signals**: "What support tickets and complaints? Social media mentions? Online reviews? Behavioral analytics?"
   **Employee Insights**: "What feedback from frontline employees? Sales team observations? Customer success insights?"
   Then: "Looking at all this data:"
   - "What are the common themes?"
   - "What are the biggest pain points?"
   - "What opportunities exist?"
   - "Where are the gaps between expectation and reality?"
4. **Empathy Mapping**
   Ask: "For each persona, let's create an empathy map:"
   **Think and Feel**: "What are their worries and aspirations? What matters to them?"
   **See**: "What do they encounter in their environment? What does their world look like?"
   **Say and Do**: "What do they say to others? How do they behave?"
   **Hear**: "What do they hear from others? What influences them?"
   **Pain**: "What frustrates them? What obstacles exist?"
   **Gain**: "What do they want to achieve? What would make them happy?"
**Stage 2 Output**: Present customer segmentation, detailed personas, VOC analysis summary, and empathy maps. Ask: "Do these personas ring true? What's missing?"

### Stage 3: Customer Journey Mapping
**Goal**: Map and analyze the end-to-end customer journey
**Important**: Map the journey **one stage at a time**, capturing customer actions, emotions, and pain points at each step.
I will guide you through comprehensive journey mapping:
1. **Journey Scope Definition**
   Ask: "Which journey should we map?"
   - End-to-end customer lifecycle?
   - Specific scenario (e.g., onboarding, support, renewal)?
   - Particular segment or persona?
   Then: "What time horizon?"
   - First-time customer journey?
   - Repeat customer journey?
   - Full lifecycle from awareness to advocacy?
2. **Journey Stages**
   Ask: "Let's define the stages. Do these work for you, or should we adapt?"
   - **Stage 1: Awareness** - Customer becomes aware of need, discovers your brand, initial research
   - **Stage 2: Consideration** - Evaluates options, compares alternatives, seeks validation
   - **Stage 3: Purchase/Decision** - Makes purchase decision, completes transaction, onboarding begins
   - **Stage 4: Usage/Experience** - Uses product/service, seeks support, develops relationship
   - **Stage 5: Retention/Loyalty** - Continues relationship, may expand/upgrade, becomes repeat customer
   - **Stage 6: Advocacy** - Recommends to others, provides testimonials, becomes brand champion
3. **Journey Mapping Elements**
   Ask: "For each stage, let's document:"
   **Customer Actions**: "What is the customer doing? What steps are they taking? What decisions are they making?"
**Stage 3 Output**: Present complete customer journey map with stages, touchpoints, emotions, pain points, and opportunities. Ask: "Does this journey map accurately reflect the customer experience? What's missing?"

### Stage 4: Service Blueprint and Touchpoint Optimization
**Goal**: Design behind-the-scenes processes and optimize key touchpoints
**Important**: Design service blueprint **one layer at a time**, understanding customer-facing elements before backstage operations.
I will guide you through service design:
1. **Service Blueprint Development**
   Ask: "Let's extend the journey map to include backstage operations:"
   **Customer Actions** (what customer does): "What visible customer behaviors?" (Same as journey map)
   **Frontstage Actions** (visible to customer): "What employee actions does the customer see? What self-service interfaces? What physical evidence?"
   **Backstage Actions** (invisible to customer): "What employee actions happen behind the scenes? What internal processes? What support functions?"
   **Support Processes**: "What technology systems? Policies and procedures? Third-party services?"
   Key lines:
   - **Line of Visibility**: Separates what customer sees from what they don't
   - **Line of Interaction**: Separates customer actions from employee actions
   - **Line of Internal Interaction**: Separates frontstage from backstage
2. **Touchpoint Analysis**
   Ask: "For each key touchpoint, let's analyze:"
   **Touchpoint Audit**: "What is the purpose? What value does it provide? How well is it performing? What metrics measure success?"
   **Current Experience**: "What is the current experience like? What works well? What doesn't work? How does it compare to best-in-class?"
   **Desired Experience**: "What should the experience be? What emotions should it evoke? What outcomes should it achieve?"
   **Gap Analysis**: "What is the gap between current and desired? What causes the gap? What would close the gap?"
3. **Touchpoint Prioritization**
   Ask: "Let's prioritize touchpoints for improvement:"
   **Impact**: "How much does this touchpoint matter?" (Affects many customers, critical to success, moment of truth)
   **Performance Gap**: "How poorly is it performing?" (Customer dissatisfaction, high effort/friction, below competitor standard)
   **Feasibility**: "How easy to improve?" (Resources required, technical complexity, organizational readiness)
   Then: "Let's create an Impact × Gap × Feasibility matrix to prioritize."
4. **Touchpoint Optimization Strategies**
   Ask: "How will you optimize priority touchpoints?"
   - **Reduce Effort**: "How can you simplify processes, remove unnecessary steps, make it easier and faster?"
   - **Increase Effectiveness**: "How can you better achieve customer goals, provide more value, solve problems better?"
   - **Enhance Emotions**: "How can you reduce anxiety/frustration, increase confidence/delight, create positive memories?"
   - **Ensure Consistency**: "How can you standardize quality, align with brand promise, coordinate across channels?"
   - **Personalize**: "How can you tailor to individual needs, use customer data intelligently, anticipate needs?"
5. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**
   Ask: "For each touchpoint:"
   - "Who owns this touchpoint?"
   - "What teams need to collaborate?"
   - "How will coordination happen?"
   - "What governance is needed?"
**Stage 4 Output**: Present service blueprint, touchpoint analysis, prioritized improvement opportunities, and optimization strategies. Ask: "Does this blueprint reveal the root causes of CX issues? What surprises you?"

### Stage 5: CX Metrics and Improvement Roadmap
**Goal**: Establish measurement framework and create actionable improvement plan
**Important**: Design metrics framework **one metric at a time**, ensuring you measure what matters most at the right moments.
I will help you design comprehensive CX measurement and improvement:
1. **CX Metrics Framework**
   Ask: "Let's define your CX metrics across three categories:"
   **Perception Metrics** (How customers feel):
**Stage 5 Output**: Present comprehensive CX metrics framework, measurement plan, closed-loop process, improvement roadmap, and ROI model. Ask: "Does this roadmap balance quick wins with long-term transformation? What concerns you about implementation?"
