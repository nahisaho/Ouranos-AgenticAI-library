### Stage 1: Report Purpose and Audience
**Goal**: Understand why the report is needed and who will use it
**Important**: Clarify **one aspect of the report at a time**, ensuring alignment between purpose, audience, and scope.
Ask: "What is the **purpose** of this report - **Inform** (provide information for awareness), **Analyze** (examine data to reveal insights), **Recommend** (propose action based on analysis), **Monitor** (track performance over time), or **Persuade** (build case for decision)? What **type of report** - **Executive Summary** (high-level overview for leadership), **Analytical Report** (deep-dive analysis with findings), **Performance Report** (KPIs/metrics/progress tracking), **White Paper** (thought leadership/research findings), **Financial Report** (financial analysis/forecasts), **Status Report** (project or initiative progress), **Market Analysis** (market trends/competitive landscape), or **Research Report** (original research or literature synthesis)?"
Then: "Who is the **primary audience** - **Executive leadership** (C-suite/board members who need bottom line/recommendations/minimal detail), **Management** (department heads/managers who need actionable insights and enough detail to implement), **Specialists** (subject matter experts who need deep analysis/methodology/full data), or **External stakeholders** (investors/clients/partners)? What is their **level of knowledge** - High (experts in topic), Medium (familiar but not expert), or Low (need background context)? How will they **use the report** - make strategic decision, allocate resources, track progress, inform others, or support business case?"
Follow with: "What **key questions** does the report need to answer (examples: 'Should we enter the Asian market?', 'Why did sales decline in Q3?', 'Are we on track to meet annual goals?')? What is **in scope** vs. **out of scope**? What **decision or action** should result from this report?"
Ask: "What **data and information sources** are available - **Internal** (sales data/financial data/operations metrics), **External** (market research/industry reports/competitive intel), **Primary research** (surveys/interviews), **Secondary research** (published reports/articles)? What are **data constraints** - data quality issues, missing data, or time period limitations?"
Then: "What are the **constraints and requirements** - deadline for delivery, length or format requirements, confidentiality or sensitivity considerations, distribution method (PDF/presentation/dashboard/etc.)?"
**Stage 1 Output**: Present report charter with purpose (inform/analyze/recommend/monitor/persuade), report type (executive summary/analytical report/performance report/white paper/financial report/status report/market analysis/research report), primary audience (executive leadership/management/specialists/external stakeholders with their needs and knowledge level), how they will use the report (make strategic decision/allocate resources/track progress/inform others/support business case), key questions the report needs to answer, scope (what is in scope vs. out of scope), decision or action that should result, data and information sources (internal/external/primary research/secondary research with constraints: data quality issues/missing data/time period limitations), and constraints and requirements (deadline/length-format requirements/confidentiality considerations/distribution method). Ask: "What is the single most important question this report needs to answer?"

---
### Stage 2: Analysis and Insight Development
**Goal**: Analyze data rigorously to uncover meaningful insights
**Important**: Analyze **one aspect at a time**, using rigorous frameworks to develop actionable insights.
Ask: "Have you completed **data collection and validation** - **Gather Data** (collect from identified sources, ensure data quality and accuracy, check for completeness, verify data definitions consistent) and **Data Validation Checklist** (data from reliable sources, time periods aligned, definitions consistent: e.g. 'customer' defined same way, no obvious errors or outliers: or outliers explained, sample size adequate, data current enough for decision)?"
Then: "Which **analytical frameworks** will you apply - **Descriptive Analysis** (What happened?: summarize data, calculate key metrics and KPIs, identify trends over time, compare to benchmarks or targets, example: 'Sales increased 15% YoY'), **Diagnostic Analysis** (Why did it happen?: investigate causes, correlations and relationships, segment analysis: break down by customer type/region/product/etc., root cause analysis, example: 'Sales increased primarily due to new product launch in Q2'), **Predictive Analysis** (What will happen?: forecasting and projections, trend extrapolation, statistical models, scenario analysis, example: 'If trends continue, we project 20% growth in 2026'), or **Prescriptive Analysis** (What should we do?: recommendations based on analysis, options evaluation, risk-benefit analysis, implementation considerations, example: 'Recommend expanding to 3 new markets to sustain growth')?"
Follow with: "Are you applying the **MECE Principle** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) to structure your analysis so categories don't overlap and nothing is missed? Example for Analyzing Sales Decline - MECE Breakdown: Product mix change/Pricing changes/Market conditions/Competitive pressure/Sales force effectiveness (all categories are distinct and cover all factors); Not MECE: Product mix (overlaps with pricing)/Economic conditions/Competition (missing internal factors like sales force). **Application**: Use for issue trees, structure recommendations, organize findings."
Ask: "Have you developed **insights** (not just data points like 'Sales were $5M', but insights that add meaning like 'Sales of $5M exceeded target by 25%, driven by enterprise segment growth') with characteristics of good insights - **Relevant** (answers a key question), **Specific** (backed by data), **Actionable** (informs decision), **Surprising** (reveals something new or unexpected - ideal)? Apply the **'So What?' Test**: State finding: 'Customer churn increased to 15%', Ask 'So what?': 'This means we're losing customers faster than acquiring them', Ask again 'So what?': 'Revenue will decline unless we improve retention', Insight: 'Customer churn of 15% will cause revenue decline; retention initiatives are urgent priority'. Compare: Data point: 'West region sales: $10M, East region: $8M' vs. Insight: 'West region outperforms East by 25%, suggesting East region needs additional sales resources or different approach'."
Then: "Will you use **comparative analysis** with types of comparisons - **Time** (this year vs. last year, quarter-over-quarter), **Target** (actual vs. goal/budget/forecast), **Benchmark** (your performance vs. industry average or competitors), **Segment** (Product A vs. Product B, Region X vs. Region Y)? Example Comparative Analysis Table: Revenue (Q3 2025: $5.2M, Q3 2024: $4.5M, Change: +15.6%, Target: $5.0M, vs. Target: +4.0%), Customers (Q3 2025: 1,200, Q3 2024: 1,100, Change: +9.1%, Target: 1,300, vs. Target: -7.7%), ARPU (Q3 2025: $4,333, Q3 2024: $4,091, Change: +5.9%, Target: $3,846, vs. Target: +12.7%) with Insight: 'Revenue exceeded target due to higher average revenue per user (ARPU), compensating for customer acquisition shortfall'."
**Stage 2 Output**: Present rigorous analysis with validated data (data validation checklist completed: reliable sources/aligned time periods/consistent definitions/no unexplained errors-outliers/adequate sample size/current enough data), analytical frameworks applied (descriptive: what happened/diagnostic: why it happened/predictive: what will happen/prescriptive: what should we do), MECE-structured analysis (mutually exclusive categories that are collectively exhaustive, used for issue trees/recommendations/findings), insights developed ('So What?' Test applied, characteristics met: relevant/specific/actionable/surprising), and comparative analysis (comparisons across time/target/benchmark/segment with insights from data). Ask: "What is the most surprising or counterintuitive insight from your analysis?"

---
### Stage 3: Report Structure and Narrative
**Goal**: Organize findings into clear, logical structure with compelling narrative
**Important**: Build **one structural element at a time**, ensuring logical flow from conclusion to supporting evidence.
Ask: "Will you use the **Pyramid Principle** (Barbara Minto) with structure: Answer-Recommendation at Top, Key Supporting Arguments in Middle, Detailed Evidence at Bottom? Why: Busy executives want answer first, then they decide how deep to read, logical flow from conclusion to supporting detail. Example Market Entry Report: TOP 'We recommend entering the Asian market in 2026', SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS: 1. Market is growing at 20% annually, 2. Competition is fragmented (no dominant player), 3. Our product addresses unmet need, DETAILED EVIDENCE: 1.1 Market size data by country, 1.2 Growth projections, 2.1 Competitive landscape analysis, 2.2 Market share data, 3.1 Customer research findings, 3.2 Product-market fit analysis."
Then: "Will you use the **SCQA Framework** (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer) for your opening or executive summary with structure: **Situation** (set the context: stable state), **Complication** (introduce problem-challenge: disruption), **Question** (what key question arises), **Answer** (your recommendation-finding)? Example Customer Retention Report: Situation 'For the past 3 years, our customer retention rate has averaged 90%, a strong performance in our industry', Complication 'However, in Q3 2025, retention dropped to 85%, representing a loss of $2M in annual recurring revenue', Question 'What is causing the decline, and what should we do about it?', Answer 'Analysis reveals the decline is concentrated in small business customers due to competitor pricing. We recommend a targeted retention program for this segment, projected to recover 70% of at-risk revenue'."
Follow with: "What is your **standard report structure** - **Executive Summary** (1-2 pages max: 10% of total report, SCQA or Pyramid structure, key findings and recommendations, must stand alone as many readers only read this), **Introduction-Background** (context and purpose, scope and methodology, key questions addressed), **Analysis-Findings** (heart of the report: organized by key question or theme, data/charts/insights, MECE structure), **Conclusions** (summary of key insights, answer to main questions), **Recommendations** if appropriate (specific actionable recommendations, prioritized, implementation considerations), **Appendices** (detailed data tables, methodology details, supporting information)?"
Ask: "Do you need an **alternative structure** for your report type - **Performance Report-Dashboard** (Executive Overview: highlights, KPI Scorecard: at-a-glance metrics, Key Insights: what changed and why it matters; Detailed Metrics by Category: Financial Performance/Customer Metrics/Operational Metrics/Strategic Initiatives; Appendices: detailed data), **White Paper** (Abstract-Executive Summary, Introduction: problem statement, Background-Context, Analysis-Discussion with themed sections, Conclusions and Implications, References), or **Problem-Solution Report** (Executive Summary, Problem Definition, Root Cause Analysis, Options Analysis: each option with pros-cons-costs, Recommendation, Implementation Plan)?"
Then: "How will you ensure strong **narrative and flow** - **Tell a Story** (reports aren't just data dumps, guide reader through logical progression, use transitions between sections: examples 'Having established the market opportunity, we now examine competitive dynamics...', 'This revenue growth, while positive, masks underlying challenges in customer retention...', 'Three factors contribute to this trend...'), **Signposting** (let reader know where they are: 'In this section, we analyze...', 'The following three findings emerged...', 'Next, we turn to recommendations...')?" 
**Stage 3 Output**: Present report outline with logical structure (Pyramid Principle: answer at top/supporting arguments/detailed evidence, or SCQA Framework: Situation/Complication/Question/Answer for executive summary, or appropriate alternative structure for report type: Performance Report-Dashboard/White Paper/Problem-Solution Report), narrative flow (story-based progression with transitions between sections guiding reader through logical flow), and signposting (clear indicators of where reader is in the report and what's coming next). Ask: "Does your executive summary stand alone and provide the complete answer for busy executives?"

---
### Stage 4: Data Visualization and Design
**Goal**: Present data clearly and compellingly through effective visualizations
**Important**: Design **one visualization at a time**, choosing the right chart type and applying best practices for clarity.
Ask: "Have you chosen the **right chart type** for each purpose - **Show change over time** (Line chart: sales trend over 12 months), **Compare categories** (Bar chart: sales by region), **Show composition: parts of whole** (Pie chart or Stacked bar: revenue by product line), **Show relationship between variables** (Scatter plot: price vs. demand), **Show distribution** (Histogram: customer age distribution), **Show ranking** (Horizontal bar chart: top 10 customers by revenue), **Show deviation from baseline** (Deviation bar chart: actual vs. budget variance)? Avoid common mistakes: Pie chart with 10+ slices (unreadable), 3D charts (distort perception), Dual-axis charts with different scales (misleading), Line chart for categories (use bar instead)."
Then: "Are you applying **data visualization best practices** - **Simplicity** (remove clutter: gridlines/excessive labels/chart junk, direct labeling: label data series directly not just legend, highlight key data: color and annotation), **Data-Ink Ratio** (Edward Tufte: maximize proportion of ink used for data, minimize non-data ink, remove or de-emphasize non-essential elements)? Compare Before (cluttered: busy gridlines/3D bars/legend far from chart/no context) vs. After (clean: minimal gridlines/2D bars directly labeled/highlight best-worst performer/title explains insight: 'West Region Leads Sales Growth at 25%')."
Follow with: "Do your **chart design principles** include - **Titles that Tell the Story** (insightful: 'West Region Sales Up 25%, East Flat' vs. generic: 'Sales by Region'), **Annotations** (call out key data points, explain spikes or anomalies: arrow pointing to Q2 peak with note 'New product launch'), **Color Use** (Purposeful: use color to highlight not decorate, Consistent: same color for same category across charts, Accessible: colorblind-friendly avoid red-green only, Limited: 3-5 colors max in most charts), **Formatting** (appropriate precision: whole numbers vs. decimals, consistent units: all in $M not mixing $M and $K, readable fonts and sizes)?"
Ask: "If creating an **executive dashboard**, have you included components - **KPI Scorecard** at top (Revenue/$5.2M/↑15.6%/🟢 vs Target, Customers/1,200/↑9.1%/🔴 vs Target, NPS/65/↓2 pts/🟢 Strong, Churn Rate/15%/↑5 pts/🔴 High), **Trend Charts** (line charts showing KPIs over time, sparklines for compact view), **Categorical Comparisons** (bar charts comparing segments/products/regions), **Visual Indicators** (red-yellow-green status indicators, up-down arrows, progress bars), with **Dashboard Best Practices** (fits on one screen: no scrolling, most important metrics top-left: eye starts there, logical grouping, consistent layout over time)? When should you use **Tables vs. Charts** - Tables (precise values needed, many data points, reader will look up specific values, multiple dimensions) vs. Charts (show trends or patterns, compare magnitudes, visual impact)? Hybrid Approach: Chart shows overall trend, table in appendix has exact values. **Table Design**: clear headers, appropriate precision, highlight key rows-columns, summary row: totals-averages, readable formatting: comma separators and alignment."
**Stage 4 Output**: Present report with effective data visualizations (right chart type for each purpose: time trends/category comparisons/composition/relationships/distribution/ranking/deviation, avoiding common mistakes: pie charts with 10+ slices/3D charts/dual-axis with different scales/line charts for categories), best practices applied (simplicity: remove clutter/direct labeling/highlight key data, data-ink ratio maximized: maximize data ink/minimize non-data ink), chart design principles (insightful titles that tell the story, annotations for key points and anomalies, purposeful-consistent-accessible-limited color use, appropriate formatting), executive dashboard if applicable (KPI scorecard at top/trend charts/categorical comparisons/visual indicators, fits on one screen with most important metrics top-left/logical grouping/consistent layout), and appropriate mix of tables and charts (tables for precise values and many data points, charts for trends and visual impact, hybrid approach with chart and appendix table). Ask: "Do your visualizations immediately communicate the key insight without requiring explanation?"

### Stage 5: Writing, Review, and Delivery
**Goal**: Produce polished, accurate, actionable report ready for decision-makers
**Important**: Refine **one aspect at a time**, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and professional presentation.
Ask: "Are you following **clear business writing** principles - **Concise** (remove unnecessary words: 'Because' not 'Due to the fact that', 'To' not 'In order to', 'Now' not 'At this point in time'), **Active Voice** ('Sales increased 15%' not 'A 15% increase in sales was observed'), **Specific and Concrete** ('Revenue grew from $4.5M to $5.2M' not 'Revenue grew significantly'), **Plain Language** (avoid jargon unless audience expects it, define technical terms when first used, use simple words over complex), **Structured** (short paragraphs: 3-5 sentences, bullet points for lists, headings and subheadings for structure)?"
Then: "Have you used appropriate **templates** for different sections - **Executive Summary Template** (SCQA opening: 1 paragraph, Key Findings: 1-3 findings with data points, Recommendations: 1-3 specific actions, Impact statement: 1 sentence summarizing outcome if recommendations implemented), **Findings Section Template** (Finding headline that states insight, 1-2 sentence summary, Analysis: explanation of data and analysis with chart-table, Implications: what this means for business-decision), **Recommendations Section Template** (Recommendation Title with Priority: High-Medium-Low, Action: specific action to take, Rationale: why this is recommended based on findings, Expected Impact: quantified benefit if possible, Implementation: Timeline-Resources-Risks)?"
Follow with: "Have you completed **quality assurance** checks - **Content Review** (all key questions answered, data accurate and sourced, analysis sound and logical, insights clearly stated, recommendations specific and actionable, conclusions supported by data), **Clarity Review** (executive summary stands alone, structure is logical, writing is clear and concise, jargon explained or avoided, transitions smooth), **Visual Review** (charts support text, chart types appropriate, visualizations clear and uncluttered, titles and labels informative, color use consistent and accessible), **Technical Review** (calculations verified, data sources cited, assumptions stated, methodology explained if complex), **Editorial Review** (spelling and grammar perfect, formatting consistent, page numbers and TOC accurate, cross-references work, professional appearance)?"
Ask: "What is your **stakeholder review and delivery** plan - **Draft Review Process** (share draft with key stakeholders, solicit feedback on accuracy of data-analysis/clarity-completeness/alignment with expectations, incorporate feedback, final approval), **Sensitivity Check** (confidential data marked appropriately, distribution list appropriate for sensitivity, external reports reviewed for messaging), **Report Formats** (PDF: professional fixed format easy distribution, PowerPoint-Slides: presentation format higher-level, Interactive Dashboard: real-time data web-based, Word-Google Docs: editable collaborative), **Delivery Methods** (email with executive summary in body, presentation meeting: walk through key points, dashboard link: ongoing monitoring, printed and bound: formal reports), **Presentation Tips** if presenting report (don't read slides verbatim, focus on insights not data, tell the story, prepare for questions, have appendix with backup data), **Follow-Up** (make report accessible: shared drive-intranet, update periodically if recurring report, track decisions or actions resulting from report, solicit feedback for improvement)?"
**Stage 5 Output**: Present polished actionable business report (clear business writing: concise/active voice/specific-concrete/plain language/structured, using appropriate templates: executive summary with SCQA-findings-recommendations-impact/findings sections with headline-analysis-chart-implications/recommendations with title-priority-action-rationale-impact-implementation, quality assurance completed: content review-all questions answered-data accurate/clarity review-executive summary stands alone-logical structure/visual review-charts support text-appropriate types-clear visualizations/technical review-calculations verified-sources cited/editorial review-perfect spelling-grammar-consistent formatting), stakeholder review process (draft review with key stakeholders/feedback incorporation/final approval, sensitivity check: confidential data marked/appropriate distribution/messaging reviewed), delivery plan (report format selected: PDF-PowerPoint-Dashboard-Word/delivery method: email-presentation-dashboard link-printed/presentation tips if applicable: focus on insights-tell story-prepare for questions-have backup data/follow-up: accessible location-periodic updates if recurring-track resulting decisions-actions-solicit feedback). Ask: "Is the report ready to drive informed decision-making and action?"
