### Stage 1: Context and Engagement Purpose
**Goal**: Understand the decision-making context and define engagement purpose
**Important**: Explore context **one area at a time** to fully understand the engagement landscape and community needs.
Explore the following areas:
1. **Decision or Project Context**
   Ask: "What decision or project requires community engagement?
   - What decision, policy, or project requires community engagement?
     - **Policy development**: Creating new policy
     - **Program design**: Designing public service or program
     - **Planning**: Urban planning, transportation, development
     - **Implementation**: How to implement decision
     - **Evaluation**: Assessing program or policy
     - **Problem-solving**: Addressing community issue
   - What is the current stage?
     - Early (broad input on problem definition)
     - Middle (evaluating options)
     - Late (refining details, implementation planning)
   - Who is leading? (government agency, nonprofit, community group, partnership)"
2. **Engagement Purpose and Level**
   Then: "What is the appropriate level of community participation?
   **IAP2 Spectrum of Public Participation**:
   **Level 1: INFORM** (one-way communication):
   - **Goal**: Provide information to public
   - **Promise**: "We will keep you informed"
   - **Techniques**: Websites, fact sheets, newsletters, open houses
   - **When**: When decision already made, public needs to know
   **Level 2: CONSULT** (gather feedback):
   - **Goal**: Obtain public feedback on proposals
   - **Promise**: "We will listen to your concerns and provide feedback on how input influenced decision"
   - **Techniques**: Surveys, public hearings, focus groups, public comment
   - **When**: Want input but final decision rests with authority
   **Level 3: INVOLVE** (work with public):
   - **Goal**: Work directly with public throughout process
   - **Promise**: "We will work with you to ensure concerns and aspirations are understood and considered"
   - **Techniques**: Workshops, deliberative forums, advisory committees
   - **When**: Want ongoing dialogue and deeper understanding
   **Level 4: COLLABORATE** (partner):
   - **Goal**: Partner with public in decision-making
   - **Promise**: "We will look to you for advice and innovation and incorporate your recommendations to maximum extent possible"
   - **Techniques**: Citizen advisory committees, consensus-building, participatory decision-making
   - **When**: Complex issues requiring shared ownership
   **Level 5: EMPOWER** (community decides):
   - **Goal**: Place final decision-making in hands of public

   │  (High power, high       (High power, low
   │   interest)              interest)
   │
   │  KEEP INFORMED           MONITOR
   │  (Low power, high        (Low power, low
   │   interest)              interest)
   │
   └─────────────────────────────────── High Interest
   ```
   **For Each Stakeholder Group**:
   - Interests and concerns
   - Level of power/influence
   - Level of interest

   - Meet people where they are
   **Example - Transportation Planning Project**:
   | Stakeholder Group | Engagement Approach | Rationale |
   |-------------------|---------------------|-----------|
   | **Transit riders** (directly affected) | In-person workshops at transit hubs, online survey, focus groups | High interest; need deep input on needs; meet at convenient locations |
   | **Community organizations** | Advisory committee, co-design sessions | Partners; can help reach members; collaborative level |
   | **Business owners** | Business association meetings, interviews | Moderate interest; specific concerns; go to their meetings |
   | **General public** | Online engagement platform, public meetings, survey | Lower direct interest; need awareness; multiple accessible options |
   | **Elected officials** | Briefings, presentations | High power; keep informed; influence decision |
   | **Youth** | School presentations, youth advisory group, social media | Affected but often excluded; age-appropriate methods |

   **Example - Park Redesign Input Analysis**:
   **Themes**:
   1. **Safety concerns** (mentioned by 65% of participants)
      - Better lighting
      - Visibility (trim overgrown vegetation)
      - Emergency call boxes
   2. **More amenities for children** (45%)
      - Updated playground equipment
      - Splash pad
      - Family picnic areas
   3. **Preservation of natural areas** (40%)
      - Don't over-develop
      - Protect trees
      - Native plantings
   4. **Accessibility improvements** (30%)
      - Accessible pathways
      - Accessible playground
      - Seating with back support
   **Divergent Views**:
   - Youth wanted skate park; seniors concerned about noise
   - Dog owners wanted off-leash area; parents concerned about safety around children"
2. **Integrating Input into Decisions**
   Then: "How will you integrate community input into decision-making?
   **Decision-Making Process**:
   **Review Input**:
   - Decision-makers review synthesis of community input
   - Consider alongside other factors (budget, regulations, technical feasibility)
   **Weigh Tradeoffs**:
   - Competing priorities and preferences
   - Can't please everyone
   - How to balance?
   **Example Decision Process - Park Redesign**:
   **Input Says**: Community wants safety improvements, children's amenities, preserve nature, accessibility
   **Constraints**: $500K budget, must comply with ADA, environmental regulations
   **Decision**:
   - **Priority 1** (safety): Lighting upgrades, vegetation management [$100K] - addressed most frequent concern
   - **Priority 2** (accessibility): Accessible pathways, accessible playground [$150K] - legal requirement + community priority
   - **Priority 3** (children): New playground equipment [$150K] - high demand
   - **Priority 4** (nature): Native plantings, preserve trees [$50K] - integrate into design
   - **Deferred**: Splash pad ($200K) - not enough budget; consider for future phase
   - **Compromise on dog park/skate park**: Designated times/areas to address both interests
   **Documenting Rationale**:
   - Why each decision made
   - How input influenced
   - Why some input not incorporated (constraints, tradeoffs)"
3. **"What We Heard" Report**
   Follow with: "How will you report back to the community?
   **Purpose**: Report back to community on what was heard and how it influenced decisions
   **Structure**:
   ```markdown
   # What We Heard: [Project Name] Community Engagement

   ```
   **Example Excerpt**:
   "Safety was the #1 concern we heard from community members. You told us that poor lighting and overgrown vegetation make the park feel unsafe, especially in evening hours. In response, we are:
   - Installing 20 new LED lights along all main pathways
   - Creating a vegetation management plan to improve sightlines
   - Adding emergency call boxes at three locations
   These improvements will be completed by Spring 2026."
   **Distribution**:
   - Website
   - Email to participants
   - Social media
   - Community presentation
   - Media release
   - Postcards to area residents"
4. **Ongoing Communication and Implementation**
   Ask: "How will you maintain ongoing communication and involve community in implementation?
   **Stay Connected**:
   - Email list for updates
   - Project website with progress updates
   - Social media
   - Regular community meetings
   **Involve in Implementation**:
   - Volunteer opportunities (tree planting, cleanup)
   - Implementation advisory committee
   - Celebration events (grand opening, ribbon cutting)
   **Demonstrate Impact**:
   - "Before and after" photos
   - Success stories
   - Data on outcomes (usage, satisfaction)"
5. **Evaluation and Learning**
   Then: "How will you evaluate the engagement process and document lessons learned?
   **Evaluate Engagement Process**:
   - Did we reach target stakeholders?
   - Was participation diverse and representative?
   - Was input meaningful and useful?
   - What worked well?
   - What could improve?
   - Participant satisfaction survey
   **Document Lessons Learned**:
   - For future engagement efforts
   - Share learning with field
   **Build on Relationships**:
   - Engagement isn't one-and-done
   - Relationships and trust built are foundation for future collaboration
   - Maintain connections"
**Stage 5 Output**: Present your "What We Heard" report, decision integration documentation, and ongoing communication plan. Ask: "Does this reporting approach transparently show how community input shaped decisions and maintain trust for future engagement?"
