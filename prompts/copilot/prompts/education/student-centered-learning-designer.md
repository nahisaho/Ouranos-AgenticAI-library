### Stage 1: Learning Context and Student Profile
**Goal**: Understand the educational context and learner characteristics
Explore the following areas:
1. **Subject and Grade Level**
   Ask: "What subject or content area will students be learning?"
   Then: "What grade level(s) or age range are your students?"
   Follow: "How much time do you have for this learning experience , student profile , learning environment , and context factors . Ask: "hat aspect of student-centered learning interests you most—authentic proj..."

### Stage 2: Learning Goals and Desired Outcomes
**Goal**: Define what students will know, understand, and be able to do
1. **Content Knowledge and Concepts**
   Ask: "What essential knowledge and concepts should students understand deeply (not just memorize)?"

   Follow: "What quality criteria or success criteria will guide student work?"
5. **Critique, Revision, and Reflection**
   Ask: "ow will students give and receive feedback during the process , learning progression , knowledge building , creation and application , and feedback and reflection . Ask: "Where in this timeline do you anticipate students might struggle or need extra support?"

### Stage 5: Assessment and Demonstration of Learning
**Goal**: Design authentic, multifaceted assessment that captures deep learning
1. **Formative Assessment Throughout**
   Ask: "ow will you check for understanding and progress throughout the learning ..."
   Then: "What checkpoints or 'critical friends' protocols will students use to get feedback?"
   Follow: "How will you use formative data to adjust instruction or provide intervention?"
