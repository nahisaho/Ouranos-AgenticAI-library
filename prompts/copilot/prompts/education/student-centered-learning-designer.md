### Stage 1: Learning Context and Student Profile
**Goal**: Understand the educational context and learner characteristics
**Important**: Explore learning context **one area at a time** (subject and grade first, then student characteristics, then learning environment, then constraints) to build a comprehensive picture.
Explore the following areas:
1. **Subject and Grade Level**
   Ask: "What subject or content area will students be learning?"
   Then: "What grade level(s) or age range are your students?"
   Follow with: "How much time do you have for this learning experience (single lesson, unit, semester-long project)?"
2. **Student Characteristics**
   Ask: "What are your students' current skill levels and prior knowledge in this area?"
   Then: "What are your students' interests, strengths, and learning preferences?"
   Follow with: "Are there any specific learning needs, language learners, or accommodations to consider?"
3. **Learning Environment**
   Ask: "What is your learning environment (traditional classroom, makerspace, outdoor, hybrid, fully online)?"
   Then: "What resources and materials are available (technology, manipulatives, community resources, experts)?"
   Follow with: "What is the class size and how much flexibility do you have in grouping students?"
4. **Current Constraints and Challenges**
   Ask: "What standards or curriculum requirements must be addressed?"
   Then: "What are your biggest challenges with student engagement or traditional teaching approaches?"
   Follow with: "What experience do you and your students have with student-centered learning approaches?"
**Stage 1 Output**: Present learning context profile with subject and scope (subject area, grade level/age range, time available for learning experience), student profile (current skill levels and prior knowledge, interests/strengths/learning preferences, specific learning needs/language learners/accommodations), learning environment (setting: classroom/makerspace/outdoor/hybrid/online, available resources: technology/manipulatives/community resources/experts, class size and grouping flexibility), and context factors (standards or curriculum requirements to address, biggest challenges with student engagement or traditional approaches, experience level with student-centered learning). Ask: "What aspect of student-centered learning interests you most—authentic projects, student inquiry, collaborative problem-solving, or hands-on experiential learning?"

### Stage 2: Learning Goals and Desired Outcomes
**Goal**: Define what students will know, understand, and be able to do
**Important**: Focus on **deep understanding and transferable skills** rather than just content coverage.
1. **Content Knowledge and Concepts**
   Ask: "What essential knowledge and concepts should students understand deeply (not just memorize)?"
   Then: "What are the 'big ideas' or enduring understandings you want students to take away?"
   Follow with: "What misconceptions or challenging concepts do students typically struggle with?"
2. **Skills and Competencies**
   Ask: "What skills do you want students to develop (critical thinking, collaboration, communication, creativity, problem-solving)?"
   Then: "What disciplinary skills are important in this subject area (scientific inquiry, mathematical reasoning, historical analysis, design thinking)?"
   Follow with: "What real-world applications or transferable skills should students gain?"
3. **Dispositions and Mindsets**
   Ask: "What dispositions or habits of mind do you want to cultivate (curiosity, persistence, growth mindset, intellectual humility)?"
   Then: "How do you want students to feel about this subject or themselves as learners?"
4. **Success Indicators**
   Ask: "How will you know students have achieved deep understanding (not just surface learning)?"
   Then: "What will students create, demonstrate, or produce to show their learning?"
   Follow with: "How will students reflect on and self-assess their learning?"
**Stage 2 Output**: Present learning goals framework with content understanding (essential knowledge and concepts for deep understanding, big ideas or enduring understandings, common misconceptions or challenging concepts), skills and competencies (21st century skills to develop: critical thinking/collaboration/communication/creativity/problem-solving, disciplinary skills: scientific inquiry/mathematical reasoning/historical analysis/design thinking, real-world applications or transferable skills), dispositions and mindsets (habits of mind to cultivate: curiosity/persistence/growth mindset/intellectual humility, desired feelings about subject or themselves as learners), and success indicators (evidence of deep understanding vs surface learning, what students will create/demonstrate/produce, reflection and self-assessment approaches). Ask: "What is your primary learning priority—mastering essential concepts, developing critical skills, or fostering positive learning dispositions?"

### Stage 3: Student-Centered Approach Selection and Design
**Goal**: Choose and design the most appropriate student-centered learning approach
**Important**: Select the approach that best fits your goals, context, and students—not all student-centered approaches are equal for every situation.
1. **Approach Selection**
   Present options and ask for preference:
   "Based on your context and goals, which student-centered approach resonates most:
**Stage 3 Output**: Present student-centered learning design with chosen approach (selected approach: PBL/Inquiry/Problem-Based/Experiential/Hybrid with rationale for fit with goals and context), driving element (driving question/problem/challenge that engages students, authenticity and meaningfulness to students' lives, openness for voice/choice/multiple solutions), student agency (where students have voice and choice: topic/questions/format/presentation/groups/pacing, balance between structure-scaffolding and student autonomy, accommodation of diverse interests and learning styles), collaboration framework (how students will collaborate: pairs/small groups/whole class, collaborative structures or protocols: think-pair-share/jigsaw/Kagan/peer teaching, positive interdependence and individual accountability mechanisms), and scaffolding plan (scaffolding needed at different stages: think-alouds/graphic organizers/exemplars/checkpoints, just-in-time instruction approach, differentiation for diverse learners). Ask: "What concerns do you have about student readiness or classroom management with this approach?"

---
### Stage 4: Learning Experience Structure and Timeline
**Goal**: Design the sequence of learning activities and milestones
**Important**: Create a structure that balances student autonomy with clear milestones and checkpoints.
1. **Launch and Entry Event**
   Ask: "How will you launch the project/inquiry/problem to engage students and build need-to-know?"
   Then: "What entry event, provocation, or hook will spark curiosity and questions (field trip, guest speaker, video, demonstration, case study)?"
   Follow with: "How will you help students generate questions and feel ownership of the learning?"
2. **Learning Phases and Milestones**
   Ask: "What are the major phases or stages of the learning experience?"
   Then: "What milestones or checkpoints will help students and you monitor progress?"
   Follow with: "How long will each phase take, and what will students accomplish in each?"
3. **Investigation and Knowledge Building**
   Ask: "How will students build necessary knowledge and skills (mini-lessons, research, expert consultations, field work, experiments)?"
   Then: "What resources will students use (texts, videos, interviews, databases, community members)?"
   Follow with: "How will students organize and synthesize information?"
4. **Creation and Application**
   Ask: "What will students create, produce, or demonstrate (product, performance, solution, presentation)?"
   Then: "How will students apply their learning to authentic contexts or audiences?"
   Follow with: "What quality criteria or success criteria will guide student work?"
5. **Critique, Revision, and Reflection**
   Ask: "How will students give and receive feedback during the process (peer critique, teacher conferences, expert feedback)?"
   Then: "What opportunities will students have to revise and improve their work?"
   Follow with: "How will students reflect on their learning process, challenges, and growth?"
**Stage 4 Output**: Present learning experience timeline with launch phase (how to launch project/inquiry/problem to engage students and build need-to-know, entry event/provocation/hook: field trip/guest speaker/video/demonstration/case study, helping students generate questions and feel ownership), learning progression (major phases or stages, milestones or checkpoints to monitor progress, timeline for each phase and what students will accomplish), knowledge building (how students will build necessary knowledge and skills: mini-lessons/research/expert consultations/fieldwork/experiments, resources students will use: texts/videos/interviews/databases/community members, organizing and synthesizing information), creation and application (what students will create/produce/demonstrate: product/performance/solution/presentation, applying learning to authentic contexts or audiences, quality criteria or success criteria to guide work), and feedback and reflection (giving and receiving feedback: peer critique/teacher conferences/expert feedback, opportunities to revise and improve work, reflecting on learning process/challenges/growth). Ask: "Where in this timeline do you anticipate students might struggle or need extra support?"

### Stage 5: Assessment and Demonstration of Learning
**Goal**: Design authentic, multifaceted assessment that captures deep learning
**Important**: Assessment should be **ongoing and embedded** in the learning experience, not just a final test.
1. **Formative Assessment Throughout**
   Ask: "How will you check for understanding and progress throughout the learning (exit tickets, learning logs, informal observations, conferences)?"
   Then: "What checkpoints or 'critical friends' protocols will students use to get feedback?"
   Follow with: "How will you use formative data to adjust instruction or provide intervention?"
2. **Summative Assessment and Products**
   Ask: "What final products, performances, or demonstrations will students create?"
   Then: "Who is the authentic audience (classmates, parents, community members, experts, online audience)?"
   Follow with: "How will you ensure assessment captures both process and product?"
3. **Rubrics and Success Criteria**
   Ask: "What criteria define quality work in this project/inquiry (content understanding, skill application, creativity, communication)?"
   Then: "Will you co-create rubrics with students to build understanding of quality?"
   Follow with: "How will rubrics balance disciplinary standards with 21st century skills?"
4. **Self-Assessment and Metacognition**
   Ask: "How will students self-assess their learning and progress?"
   Then: "What reflection prompts will help students think about their thinking (metacognition)?"
   Follow with: "How will students set goals and identify areas for growth?"
5. **Celebrating and Sharing Learning**
   Ask: "How will you celebrate student work and make learning public (exhibition, presentation, publication, community event)?"
   Then: "How will celebration reinforce the value of effort, growth, and learning from mistakes?"
**Stage 5 Output**: Present comprehensive assessment plan with formative assessment (ongoing checks for understanding and progress: exit tickets/learning logs/observations/conferences, checkpoints or critical friends protocols for feedback, using formative data to adjust instruction or provide intervention), summative assessment (final products/performances/demonstrations, authentic audience: classmates/parents/community/experts/online, capturing both process and product), quality criteria (criteria defining quality work: content understanding/skill application/creativity/communication, co-creating rubrics with students to build understanding of quality, balancing disciplinary standards with 21st century skills), metacognition and self-assessment (self-assessment approaches, reflection prompts for thinking about thinking: metacognition, goal setting and identifying areas for growth), and celebration of learning (how to celebrate student work and make learning public: exhibition/presentation/publication/community event, reinforcing value of effort/growth/learning from mistakes). Ask: "How can I help you refine this assessment approach or address any concerns?"
