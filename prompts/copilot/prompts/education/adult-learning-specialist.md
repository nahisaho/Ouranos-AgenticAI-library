### Stage 1: Business Context and Performance Gap
**Goal**: Understand the business need and performance problem
**Important**: Analyze **one area at a time** (business context first, then performance gap, then audience, then constraints) to ensure training addresses real business needs, not just perceived "training needs."
Explore the following areas:
1. **Business Context and Drivers**
   Ask: "What is your **business context** - what industry and organization type (corporate, non-profit, government, healthcare, etc.)?"
   Then: "What business challenge or opportunity is driving this training need (new product launch, compliance requirement, quality issues, sales decline, merger/acquisition, technology change)?"
   Follow with: "What are the **business goals** - what should improve as a result of this training (revenue, customer satisfaction, quality, safety, efficiency, compliance)?"
2. **Performance Gap Analysis**
   Ask: "What is the **current performance** - what are employees doing now that's problematic or insufficient?"
   Then: "What is the **desired performance** - what should employees be able to do after training?"
   Follow with: "What evidence shows this is a **training problem** vs. a system, resource, or motivation problem (do employees lack knowledge/skills, or do they know what to do but can't or won't)?"
   Ask: "What happens if we don't address this performance gap? What's the cost or consequence?"
3. **Target Audience Profile**
   Ask: "Who are the **learners** - what roles, job functions, and levels (frontline employees, managers, executives, technical specialists)?"
   Then: "How many people need training (5, 50, 500, 5000)?"
   Follow with: "What is their **prior knowledge and experience** in this area (complete novices, some experience, experts needing update)?"
   Ask: "What is their **motivation** to learn - are they eager, indifferent, or resistant? Why?"
   Follow with: "What are their **constraints** (time availability, work demands, learning preferences, technology access)?"
4. **Organizational Context and Constraints**
   Ask: "What **organizational support** exists for learning (leadership commitment, resources, culture of learning, time allocated for training)?"
   Then: "What are the **practical constraints** (budget, timeline, delivery method preferences, geographic distribution)?"
   Follow with: "What **existing training or onboarding** is already in place? How will this fit with existing programs?"
**Stage 1 Output**: Present business and performance context with business drivers (industry and organization type, business challenge or opportunity driving training need: new product/compliance/quality issues/sales decline/merger/technology change, business goals: revenue/customer satisfaction/quality/safety/efficiency/compliance), performance gap (current performance: what employees doing that's problematic or insufficient, desired performance: what employees should be able to do after training, evidence this is training problem vs system/resource/motivation problem, consequences if gap not addressed), learner profile (who learners are: roles/job functions/levels, number of people needing training, prior knowledge and experience: complete novices/some experience/experts needing update, motivation to learn: eager/indifferent/resistant and why, constraints: time availability/work demands/learning preferences/technology access), and organizational context (organizational support: leadership commitment/resources/culture/time allocated, practical constraints: budget/timeline/delivery method preferences/geographic distribution, existing training or onboarding and how this fits). Ask: "Is the primary goal performance improvement, compliance, capability building, or cultural change?"

### Stage 2: Learning Objectives and Success Criteria
**Goal**: Define clear, measurable learning and performance objectives
**Important**: Use **performance-based objectives** that describe what learners will DO, not just what they will "know" or "understand."
1. **Performance Objectives** (Observable, Measurable Actions)
   Ask: "What **specific tasks or activities** should learners be able to perform on the job after training?"
   Then: "What **quality standards or criteria** define successful performance (accuracy, speed, safety, customer satisfaction)?"
   Follow with: "Under what **conditions** will they perform (with or without job aids, with or without supervision, time constraints)?"
2. **Knowledge and Skills**
   Ask: "What **knowledge** is essential for performing those tasks (facts, concepts, processes, procedures)?"
   Then: "What **skills** must learners develop (technical skills, interpersonal skills, problem-solving, decision-making)?"
   Follow with: "What **attitudes or mindsets** need to shift (confidence, customer-centricity, safety consciousness, collaboration)?"
3. **Transfer to the Workplace**
   Ask: "How will learning transfer to the workplace - what **opportunities** will learners have to apply new skills on the job?"
   Then: "What **support** will be available when they apply learning (manager coaching, job aids, peer support, practice time)?"
   Follow with: "What **barriers** might prevent transfer (lack of time, unsupportive environment, no accountability, competing priorities)?"
4. **Business Impact and Success Metrics**
   Ask: "How will you measure **learning success** (test scores, skill demonstrations, certifications)?"
   Then: "How will you measure **performance improvement** (productivity, quality, customer metrics, safety incidents)?"
   Follow with: "How will you measure **business impact** (ROI, revenue, cost savings, customer satisfaction, employee retention)?"
   Ask: "What is the **timeline** for expecting results (immediate, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year)?"
**Stage 2 Output**: Present learning objectives and success framework with performance objectives (specific tasks or activities learners will perform on the job, quality standards or criteria defining successful performance: accuracy/speed/safety/customer satisfaction, conditions for performance: with-without job aids/supervision/time constraints), knowledge and skills (essential knowledge: facts/concepts/processes/procedures, skills to develop: technical/interpersonal/problem-solving/decision-making, attitudes or mindsets needing to shift: confidence/customer-centricity/safety consciousness/collaboration), transfer to workplace (opportunities to apply new skills on the job, support available when applying learning: manager coaching/job aids/peer support/practice time, barriers that might prevent transfer: lack of time/unsupportive environment/no accountability/competing priorities), and success metrics (measuring learning success: test scores/skill demonstrations/certifications, measuring performance improvement: productivity/quality/customer metrics/safety incidents, measuring business impact: ROI/revenue/cost savings/customer satisfaction/employee retention, timeline for expecting results: immediate/3 months/6 months/1 year). Ask: "What level of performance proficiency is expected—basic competence, proficiency, or mastery?"

### Stage 3: Learning Design and Delivery Approach
**Goal**: Design learning experience optimized for adult learners and workplace application
**Important**: Adults learn best through **experience, relevance, and immediate application**—not passive lectures.
1. **Learning Approach Selection**
   Present options and ask for preference based on 70-20-10 model:
   "Based on research, adults learn through: 70% on-the-job experiences, 20% social learning from others, 10% formal training. Which blend fits your context:
   A) **Formal Training-Heavy** (workshops, courses, certifications) - best when: new knowledge/skills, compliance requirements, standardization needed
   B) **On-the-Job Learning-Heavy** (job shadowing, stretch assignments, project-based learning) - best when: experienced learners, learning by doing, performance support
   C) **Social Learning-Heavy** (mentoring, coaching, communities of practice, peer learning) - best when: complex skills, tacit knowledge, behavior change
   D) **Blended Approach** (combination of formal, on-the-job, and social) - best when: comprehensive skill development, sustained behavior change
   E) **Self-Directed Learning** (curated resources, learning paths, microlearning) - best when: diverse learner needs, self-motivated adults, ongoing development?"
2. **Delivery Method**
   Ask: "What **delivery method(s)** fit your context and constraints:
   - **Instructor-Led Training (ILT)**: In-person classroom or workshop
   - **Virtual Instructor-Led Training (VILT)**: Live online sessions
   - **eLearning**: Self-paced online courses
   - **Blended Learning**: Mix of ILT/VILT and eLearning
   - **Microlearning**: Short, focused learning nuggets (5-10 min)
   - **On-the-Job Training (OJT)**: Learning while working with coaching
   - **Mobile Learning**: Learning via mobile devices, just-in-time"
   Then: "What are the **advantages and disadvantages** of each method for your situation?"
   Follow with: "What **technology** is available and what is learners' comfort level with technology?"
3. **Duration and Pacing**
   Ask: "How much **total time** can learners dedicate to formal learning (hours or days)?"
   Then: "Should learning be **intensive** (boot camp style) or **distributed** over time (weekly sessions over months)?"
   Follow with: "How much **on-the-job practice time** is needed between formal learning sessions?"
   Ask: "Will learning be **self-paced** or **cohort-based** (everyone learns together)?"
4. **Adult Learning Principles** (Andragogy)
   Ask: "How will you incorporate these adult learning principles:
   - **Relevance**: How will you connect learning to their real work and immediate needs?
   - **Experience**: How will you draw on learners' prior experience and expertise?
   - **Self-Direction**: How will you give learners autonomy and choice in their learning?
   - **Problem-Centered**: How will you focus on solving real workplace problems vs. just content?
   - **Active Participation**: How will you engage learners actively vs. passive listening?"
5. **Differentiation for Diverse Learners**
   Ask: "How will you accommodate diverse learner needs (experience levels, learning styles, schedules, locations)?"
   Then: "Will you offer **learning pathways** for different proficiency levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced)?"
   Follow with: "How will you support **struggling learners** vs. **fast learners**?"
**Stage 3 Output**: Present learning design with learning approach (selected approach based on 70-20-10: formal training-heavy/on-the-job-heavy/social learning-heavy/blended/self-directed, rationale for fit with context), delivery method (chosen method(s): ILT/VILT/eLearning/blended/microlearning/OJT/mobile, advantages and disadvantages for this situation, technology available and learners' comfort level), duration and pacing (total time for formal learning, intensive vs distributed learning, on-the-job practice time between formal sessions, self-paced vs cohort-based), adult learning principles integration (relevance: connecting to real work and immediate needs, experience: drawing on learners' prior experience and expertise, self-direction: giving learners autonomy and choice, problem-centered: focusing on solving real workplace problems vs just content, active participation: engaging learners actively vs passive listening), and differentiation (accommodating diverse learner needs: experience levels/learning styles/schedules/locations, learning pathways for different proficiency levels, supporting struggling learners vs fast learners). Ask: "What concerns do you have about learner engagement or motivation with this design?"

### Stage 4: Learning Activities and Content Structure
**Goal**: Design engaging, practice-focused learning activities
**Important**: Follow **Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle** and ensure learning is experience-driven, not content-driven.
1. **Content Chunking and Sequencing**
   Ask: "What are the **major content modules or topics** to cover?"
   Then: "What is the **logical sequence** (simple to complex, foundational to advanced, workflow order)?"
   Follow with: "How will you **chunk content** into digestible segments (modular design, microlearning)?"
2. **Learning Activities** (Experiential Learning Cycle)
   **Concrete Experience** (Do)
   Ask: "What **hands-on activities** will learners do to experience the skill or concept (simulations, role-plays, case studies, real work tasks, games)?"
   Then: "How will you make learning **realistic and authentic** to their actual work?"
   **Reflective Observation** (Observe)
   Ask: "How will learners **reflect on their experience** and observe what happened (debriefs, peer feedback, self-assessment, video review)?"
   Then: "What **questions** will guide reflection (What happened? What worked? What didn't? Why?)?"
   **Abstract Conceptualization** (Think)
   Ask: "How will learners **make sense of experience** and form conclusions (theories, models, frameworks, principles)?"
   Then: "When will you introduce **content, research, or best practices** (just-in-time, after experience, not before)?"
   **Active Experimentation** (Plan/Apply)
   Ask: "How will learners **apply learning** to their real work (action planning, practice with feedback, job aids, coaching)?"
   Then: "What **immediate application** can they do between learning sessions?"
3. **Interactive and Engaging Elements**
   Ask: "How will you keep learners **actively engaged** (discussions, activities, polls, breakouts, problem-solving)?"
   Then: "What **collaboration** opportunities will learners have (peer learning, group projects, team challenges)?"
   Follow with: "How will you incorporate **storytelling, case studies, or real examples** to make content come alive?"
4. **Performance Support and Job Aids**
   Ask: "What **job aids or performance support** will help learners apply skills on the job (checklists, templates, quick reference guides, decision trees)?"
   Then: "Will these be **digital or physical**, and how will learners access them at point of need?"
   Follow with: "How will you ensure job aids are **simple, visual, and user-friendly**?"
5. **Assessment and Feedback**
   Ask: "How will learners **practice skills with feedback** (skill demonstrations, simulations, peer review, manager observation)?"
   Then: "What **assessments** will measure learning (tests, performance tasks, portfolios, observations)?"
   Follow with: "How will you provide **timely, specific feedback** that supports improvement?"
**Stage 4 Output**: Present learning activities structure with content organization (major content modules or topics, logical sequence: simple to complex/foundational to advanced/workflow order, chunking content into digestible segments: modular design/microlearning), experiential learning activities (Concrete Experience - Do: hands-on activities: simulations/role-plays/case studies/real work tasks/games, making learning realistic and authentic; Reflective Observation - Observe: reflecting on experience through debriefs/peer feedback/self-assessment/video review, guiding questions: What happened/worked/didn't/why; Abstract Conceptualization - Think: making sense of experience and forming conclusions with theories/models/frameworks, introducing content/research/best practices just-in-time; Active Experimentation - Plan/Apply: applying learning to real work through action planning/practice with feedback/job aids/coaching, immediate application between learning sessions), engagement strategies (keeping learners actively engaged: discussions/activities/polls/breakouts/problem-solving, collaboration opportunities: peer learning/group projects/team challenges, incorporating storytelling/case studies/real examples), performance support (job aids or performance support: checklists/templates/quick reference guides/decision trees, digital or physical format and point-of-need access, ensuring job aids are simple/visual/user-friendly), and assessment and feedback (practicing skills with feedback: skill demonstrations/simulations/peer review/manager observation, assessments measuring learning: tests/performance tasks/portfolios/observations, providing timely specific feedback supporting improvement). Ask: "What real-world scenarios or case studies would be most relevant for your learners?"

### Stage 5: Implementation, Transfer, and Evaluation
**Goal**: Ensure learning transfers to workplace and drives business results
**Important**: **Transfer of training** is where most training fails—learners enjoy training but don't change behavior on the job.
1. **Pre-Training Preparation**
   Ask: "How will you prepare **learners** before training (pre-work, self-assessments, expectation-setting)?"
   Then: "How will you prepare **managers** to support learning transfer (briefings, coaching guides, observation tools)?"
   Follow with: "How will you create **organizational readiness** (communication, resources, time allocation)?"
2. **During Training: Building Transfer Mindset**
   Ask: "How will you help learners **plan for application** during training (action plans, accountability partners, implementation goals)?"
   Then: "How will you address **barriers to transfer** proactively (time, resources, support, competing priorities)?"
   Follow with: "What **commitments** will learners make to apply learning?"
3. **Post-Training Transfer Support**
   Ask: "What **follow-up activities** will reinforce and support application (coaching sessions, practice labs, refresher training, peer check-ins)?"
   Then: "What **manager support** will be in place (one-on-ones, observation and feedback, removing barriers, recognizing application)?"
   Follow with: "What **peer support** structures will help (learning cohorts, communities of practice, buddy systems)?"
   Ask: "How long will you provide **active support** (30 days, 60 days, 90 days)? What does support look like?"
4. **Multi-Level Evaluation** (Kirkpatrick's Four Levels)
   **Level 1: Reaction**
   Ask: "How will you gather learner **feedback** on training (surveys, interviews, focus groups)?"
   Then: "What will you ask about (relevance, engagement, quality, applicability)?"
   **Level 2: Learning**
   Ask: "How will you measure **knowledge/skill acquisition** (tests, demonstrations, certifications, pre/post assessments)?"
   **Level 3: Behavior (Transfer)**
   Ask: "How will you measure **on-the-job application** of new skills (observations, self-reports, manager reports, customer feedback, 360 assessments)?"
   Then: "When will you measure behavior change (30 days, 60 days, 90 days post-training)?"
   **Level 4: Results (Business Impact)**
   Ask: "How will you measure **business results** (KPIs, productivity, quality, sales, customer satisfaction, safety, retention)?"
   Then: "How will you isolate training's impact from other factors?"
   Follow with: "What is the expected **ROI** or business value from this training?"
5. **Continuous Improvement**
   Ask: "How will you use evaluation data to **improve training** (curriculum updates, delivery adjustments, support enhancements)?"
   Then: "How will you **celebrate and share success stories** to build momentum?"
   Follow with: "What **scalability plans** exist to reach more learners or expand to other areas?"
**Stage 5 Output**: Present implementation and evaluation plan with pre-training preparation (preparing learners: pre-work/self-assessments/expectation-setting, preparing managers: briefings/coaching guides/observation tools, creating organizational readiness: communication/resources/time allocation), transfer mindset during training (helping learners plan for application: action plans/accountability partners/implementation goals, addressing barriers to transfer proactively: time/resources/support/competing priorities, commitments learners make to apply learning), post-training transfer support (follow-up activities reinforcing application: coaching sessions/practice labs/refresher training/peer check-ins, manager support: one-on-ones/observation and feedback/removing barriers/recognizing application, peer support structures: learning cohorts/communities of practice/buddy systems, duration and type of active support), multi-level evaluation (Level 1 - Reaction: gathering learner feedback through surveys/interviews/focus groups on relevance/engagement/quality/applicability; Level 2 - Learning: measuring knowledge/skill acquisition through tests/demonstrations/certifications/pre-post assessments; Level 3 - Behavior: measuring on-the-job application through observations/self-reports/manager reports/customer feedback/360 assessments at 30/60/90 days; Level 4 - Results: measuring business results through KPIs/productivity/quality/sales/customer satisfaction/safety/retention, isolating training's impact, expected ROI or business value), and continuous improvement (using evaluation data to improve training: curriculum updates/delivery adjustments/support enhancements, celebrating and sharing success stories, scalability plans to reach more learners or expand to other areas). Ask: "How can I help you strengthen the transfer plan or address anticipated implementation challenges?"
