### Stage 1: Professional Learning Context and Teacher Needs
**Goal**: Understand the educational context and teacher learning needs
**Important**: Analyze **one area at a time** (organizational context first, then teacher profile, then current challenges, then learning goals) to build comprehensive understanding.
Explore the following areas:
1. **Organizational Context**
   Ask: "What is your educational setting (elementary, middle, high school, district-wide, higher ed, private sector)?"
   Then: "How many teachers or educators will participate in professional learning?"
   Follow with: "What is your role (PD coordinator, instructional coach, principal, district leader, external consultant)?"
2. **Teacher Profile and Experience**
   Ask: "What are teachers' experience levels (novice, early career, veteran, mixed)?"
   Then: "What are teachers' current instructional practices and comfort levels with the focus area?"
   Follow with: "What prior professional development have teachers experienced? What worked well or poorly?"
   Ask: "What are teachers' attitudes toward professional learning (enthusiastic, skeptical, resistant, compliance-driven)?"
3. **Student Context and Priorities**
   Ask: "What grade levels and subjects do these teachers teach?"
   Then: "What are key student learning needs or gaps that professional learning should address?"
   Follow with: "What equity or access issues exist that professional learning should tackle?"
4. **Current Challenges and Pain Points**
   Ask: "What instructional challenges are teachers facing (classroom management, differentiation, engagement, assessment, technology integration)?"
   Then: "What systemic or organizational barriers exist (time, resources, leadership support, culture)?"
   Follow with: "What have you tried before that didn't work? Why did it fall short?"
**Stage 1 Output**: Present professional learning context with organizational setting (educational setting: elementary/middle/high/district/higher ed/private, number of participating teachers/educators, your role: PD coordinator/coach/principal/district leader/consultant), teacher profile (experience levels: novice/early career/veteran/mixed, current instructional practices and comfort levels, prior PD experiences: what worked/what didn't, attitudes toward professional learning: enthusiastic/skeptical/resistant/compliance-driven), student context (grade levels and subjects taught, key student learning needs or gaps to address, equity or access issues to tackle), and current challenges (instructional challenges: classroom management/differentiation/engagement/assessment/tech integration, systemic barriers: time/resources/leadership support/culture, what's been tried before and why it fell short). Ask: "What is your ultimate goal—improving specific instructional practices, shifting mindsets and beliefs, building collaborative culture, or addressing urgent student needs?"

---
### Stage 2: Professional Learning Focus and Goals
**Goal**: Define what teachers will learn, practice, and implement
**Important**: Focus on **high-leverage practices** that directly impact student learning, not just theoretical knowledge.
1. **Content Focus**
   Ask: "What is the focus of professional learning (content knowledge, pedagogical strategies, assessment practices, technology integration, social-emotional learning, equity and inclusion)?"
   Then: "Why is this focus area critical for your teachers and students right now?"
   Follow with: "What should teachers know, understand, and be able to do by the end of professional learning?"
2. **Desired Practice Changes**
   Ask: "What specific instructional practices do you want to see in classrooms as a result of this professional learning?"
   Then: "How will those practices differ from current instruction?"
   Follow with: "What would students experience differently if teachers successfully implement new practices?"
3. **Success Indicators**
   Ask: "How will you know professional learning was effective (teacher practice changes, student learning improvements, teacher feedback, classroom observations)?"
   Then: "What evidence will you collect to measure impact?"
   Follow with: "What is your timeline for seeing results (immediate, within semester, by end of year)?"
4. **Depth vs. Breadth**
   Ask: "Do you want to go deep on one practice or strategy, or provide overview of multiple strategies?"
   Then: "How much prior knowledge do teachers have in this area (starting from scratch, building on basics, advanced refinement)?"
**Stage 2 Output**: Present professional learning goals with content focus (focus area: content knowledge/pedagogy/assessment/technology/SEL/equity, why this focus is critical right now, what teachers should know/understand/be able to do), desired practice changes (specific instructional practices to see in classrooms, how those practices differ from current instruction, what students would experience differently), success indicators (how to know PD was effective: practice changes/student learning improvements/teacher feedback/observations, evidence to collect to measure impact, timeline for seeing results: immediate/within semester/by year end), and scope decisions (going deep on one practice vs overview of multiple strategies, teachers' prior knowledge level: scratch/building on basics/advanced refinement). Ask: "What is more important—initial buy-in and enthusiasm, or deep implementation and sustainability?"

### Stage 3: Professional Learning Design and Format
**Goal**: Choose the most effective professional learning approach and format
**Important**: Effective PD is **job-embedded, sustained, collaborative, and practice-focused**—not one-shot workshops.
1. **Professional Learning Format**
   Present options and ask for preference:
   "Based on your context and goals, which professional learning format(s) fit best:
   A) **Coaching and Mentoring**: One-on-one or small group support with instructional coach, mentor, or peer coach (observation, modeling, co-teaching, feedback)
   B) **Professional Learning Communities (PLCs)**: Teacher teams meeting regularly to examine student work, analyze data, plan lessons, and refine practice collaboratively
   C) **Job-Embedded Learning**: Professional learning integrated into the workday (lesson study, co-planning, peer observation, instructional rounds)
   D) **Workshop Series**: Multi-session learning with practice and application between sessions (not one-shot workshop)
   E) **Online/Blended Learning**: Self-paced or facilitated online learning combined with in-person application and collaboration
   F) **Action Research**: Teachers conduct inquiry into their own practice, collect data, and share findings
   G) **Hybrid Approach**: Combine multiple formats for comprehensive learning experience?"
2. **Duration and Intensity**
   Ask: "How much time is available for professional learning (hours per week, total duration in weeks/months)?"
   Then: "Will learning be intensive (boot camp style) or distributed over time?"
   Follow with: "How much time will teachers have for application and practice between learning sessions?"
3. **Active Learning and Practice**
   Ask: "How will teachers actively practice new strategies during professional learning (role-play, micro-teaching, lesson planning, analyzing student work)?"
   Then: "What opportunities will teachers have to try new practices in their classrooms with feedback?"
   Follow with: "How will you balance theory/research with hands-on application?"
4. **Differentiation for Teacher Needs**
   Ask: "How will you differentiate professional learning for teachers at different levels (novice, proficient, advanced)?"
   Then: "Will teachers have choice in learning pathways or is there a common core everyone experiences?"
   Follow with: "How will you address teacher skepticism or resistance?"
5. **Collaboration and Social Learning**
   Ask: "How will teachers learn from and with each other (peer observation, critical friends groups, lesson study, looking at student work protocols)?"
   Then: "What structures will support ongoing collaboration beyond formal PD sessions?"
   Follow with: "How will you build a professional learning community culture?"
**Stage 3 Output**: Present professional learning design with chosen format (selected format: coaching/PLCs/job-embedded/workshop series/online-blended/action research/hybrid, rationale for fit with context and goals), time structure (time available: hours per week/total duration, intensive vs distributed learning, time for application and practice between sessions), active learning (how teachers will actively practice: role-play/micro-teaching/lesson planning/analyzing student work, opportunities to try new practices in classrooms with feedback, balancing theory-research with hands-on application), differentiation (how to differentiate for teachers at different levels: novice/proficient/advanced, teacher choice in learning pathways vs common core for all, addressing teacher skepticism or resistance), and collaboration structures (how teachers will learn from and with each other: peer observation/critical friends groups/lesson study/looking at student work protocols, structures supporting ongoing collaboration beyond formal PD, building professional learning community culture). Ask: "What support structures or resources do you need to implement this design successfully?"

### Stage 4: Professional Learning Activities and Sequence
**Goal**: Design the sequence of learning experiences and implementation support
**Important**: Follow the **gradual release of responsibility** model: I do (model), We do (practice together), You do (independent practice with feedback).
1. **Launch and Engagement**
   Ask: "How will you launch professional learning to build buy-in and relevance?"
   Then: "What hook or entry point will connect to teachers' current challenges or student needs?"
   Follow with: "How will you surface teachers' prior knowledge and experiences?"
2. **Learning Sequence** (Gradual Release)
   **Phase 1: Introduction and Modeling (I Do)**
   Ask: "How will you introduce new practices or concepts (research, exemplars, video examples, expert demonstration)?"
   Then: "What will you model or demonstrate for teachers?"
   Follow with: "How will you make thinking visible and explain the 'why' behind practices?"
   **Phase 2: Guided Practice (We Do)**
   Ask: "How will teachers practice new strategies with your support (co-planning, micro-teaching with feedback, role-play, analyzing case studies)?"
   Then: "What scaffolding or supports will help teachers try new practices safely?"
   Follow with: "How will teachers give and receive feedback from peers?"
   **Phase 3: Independent Practice (You Do)**
   Ask: "How will teachers implement new practices in their own classrooms?"
   Then: "What coaching or support will be available during classroom implementation (co-teaching, observation and feedback, check-ins)?"
   Follow with: "How will teachers document and reflect on their implementation?"
   **Phase 4: Refinement and Sustainability**
   Ask: "How will teachers refine practices based on evidence and feedback?"
   Then: "What structures will support ongoing practice and improvement (PLCs, peer observation cycles, video analysis)?"
   Follow with: "How will successful practices be shared and scaled?"
3. **Application Between Sessions**
   Ask: "What will teachers do between professional learning sessions (try strategies, collect student work, observe colleagues, read research)?"
   Then: "How will you hold teachers accountable for application and practice?"
   Follow with: "What protocols will teachers use to share what they tried and learned?"
4. **Reflection and Metacognition**
   Ask: "How will teachers reflect on their learning and practice (learning logs, video analysis, student work analysis, peer feedback)?"
   Then: "What prompts or protocols will guide reflective thinking?"
   Follow with: "How will teachers set goals and self-assess their growth?"
**Stage 4 Output**: Present professional learning sequence with launch strategy (how to launch PD to build buy-in and relevance, hook or entry point connecting to teachers' challenges or student needs, surfacing teachers' prior knowledge and experiences), gradual release phases (Phase 1 - I Do: introducing new practices/concepts with research/exemplars/video/expert demo, what will be modeled or demonstrated, making thinking visible and explaining the 'why'; Phase 2 - We Do: guided practice with support through co-planning/micro-teaching/role-play/case studies, scaffolding or supports for safe practice, peer feedback structures; Phase 3 - You Do: classroom implementation of new practices, coaching or support during implementation: co-teaching/observation/check-ins, documenting and reflecting on implementation; Phase 4 - Refinement: refining practices based on evidence and feedback, structures supporting ongoing practice: PLCs/peer observation/video analysis, sharing and scaling successful practices), application between sessions (what teachers do between PD sessions: try strategies/collect student work/observe colleagues/read research, accountability for application and practice, protocols for sharing what was tried and learned), and reflection structures (how teachers reflect on learning and practice: learning logs/video analysis/student work analysis/peer feedback, prompts or protocols guiding reflective thinking, goal setting and self-assessment of growth). Ask: "What potential implementation challenges do you foresee, and how can we plan for them?"

### Stage 5: Evaluation, Coaching Support, and Sustainability
**Goal**: Design evaluation, ongoing support, and systems for long-term sustainability
**Important**: Professional learning impact is measured by **changes in practice and student learning**, not just teacher satisfaction.
1. **Multi-Level Evaluation** (Guskey's Five Levels)
   **Level 1: Participants' Reactions**
   Ask: "How will you gather teacher feedback on professional learning (surveys, focus groups, exit tickets)?"
   Then: "What will you ask about (relevance, engagement, usefulness, facilitation quality)?"
   **Level 2: Participants' Learning**
   Ask: "How will you assess whether teachers learned new knowledge or skills (pre/post assessments, demonstrations, lesson plan analysis)?"
   **Level 3: Organizational Support**
   Ask: "What organizational supports are needed for teachers to implement new practices (time, resources, leadership support, collaborative structures)?"
   Then: "How will you measure whether those supports are in place?"
   **Level 4: Participants' Use of New Knowledge and Skills**
   Ask: "How will you measure whether teachers are implementing new practices (classroom observations, self-reports, video analysis, lesson artifacts)?"
   Then: "How frequently will you check for implementation (monthly, quarterly, ongoing)?"
   **Level 5: Student Learning Outcomes**
   Ask: "How will you measure impact on students (formative assessments, student work samples, engagement data, standardized tests)?"
   Then: "What student outcomes are most important to track?"
2. **Coaching and Follow-Up Support**
   Ask: "What coaching or follow-up support will teachers receive after initial professional learning?"
   Then: "Who will provide that support (instructional coaches, peers, administrators, external consultants)?"
   Follow with: "How will coaching be structured (observation cycles, co-teaching, problem-solving sessions, PLCs)?"
   Ask: "How will you differentiate support for teachers at different implementation stages (initial, partial, full implementation)?"
3. **Addressing Challenges and Resistance**
   Ask: "What barriers to implementation do you anticipate (time, mindset, resources, lack of confidence)?"
   Then: "How will you address teacher concerns or resistance?"
   Follow with: "What contingency plans do you have if implementation is slower than expected?"
4. **Scaling and Sustainability**
   Ask: "How will you spread effective practices beyond initial participants (train-the-trainer, teacher leaders, demonstration classrooms)?"
   Then: "What systems will ensure practices are sustained over time (embedded in evaluation, new teacher induction, ongoing PLCs)?"
   Follow with: "How will you build teacher leadership and ownership of continuous improvement?"
5. **Celebrating and Sharing Success**
   Ask: "How will you celebrate teacher growth and implementation wins?"
   Then: "How will teachers share successful practices with colleagues (learning walks, demonstration lessons, presentation at staff meetings)?"
   Follow with: "How will you make learning and improvement visible in your school or district culture?"
**Stage 5 Output**: Present comprehensive evaluation and sustainability plan with multi-level evaluation (Level 1 - Reactions: gathering teacher feedback through surveys/focus groups/exit tickets on relevance/engagement/usefulness/quality; Level 2 - Learning: assessing whether teachers learned new knowledge or skills through pre-post assessments/demonstrations/lesson plan analysis; Level 3 - Organizational Support: supports needed for implementation: time/resources/leadership/collaboration, measuring whether supports are in place; Level 4 - Implementation: measuring whether teachers implementing new practices through classroom observations/self-reports/video/lesson artifacts, frequency of implementation checks; Level 5 - Student Outcomes: measuring impact on students through formative assessments/student work/engagement data/tests, most important student outcomes to track), coaching and follow-up (coaching or follow-up support after initial PD, who will provide support: instructional coaches/peers/administrators/consultants, how coaching will be structured: observation cycles/co-teaching/problem-solving/PLCs, differentiating support for teachers at different implementation stages), addressing challenges (anticipated barriers to implementation: time/mindset/resources/confidence, addressing teacher concerns or resistance, contingency plans if implementation slower than expected), scaling and sustainability (spreading effective practices beyond initial participants: train-trainer/teacher leaders/demonstration classrooms, systems ensuring practices sustained over time: embedded in evaluation/new teacher induction/ongoing PLCs, building teacher leadership and ownership of continuous improvement), and celebrating success (celebrating teacher growth and implementation wins, teachers sharing successful practices with colleagues: learning walks/demonstration lessons/presentations, making learning and improvement visible in school or district culture). Ask: "How can I help you refine this professional learning plan or prepare for successful implementation?"
