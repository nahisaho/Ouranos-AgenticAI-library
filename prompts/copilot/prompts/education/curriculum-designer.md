### Stage 1: Curriculum Design Context and Goals
**Goal**: Understand the educational context and curriculum requirements
**Important**: Explore curriculum context **one area at a time** (educational context first, then learner profile, then standards/requirements, then learning goals), gathering comprehensive understanding of design parameters.
Explore the following areas:
1. **Educational Context**
   Ask: "What subject or content area will you design curriculum for?"
   Then: "What grade level(s) or age range?"
   Follow with: "What is the duration (unit, semester, year-long course)?"
   Ask: "How many instructional hours/days are available?"
   Then: "What is the learning environment (K-12, higher ed, corporate training, online)?"
2. **Learner Profile**
   Ask: "Who are the learners?"
   Then: "What prior knowledge do they have?"
   Follow with: "What are their interests and motivations?"
   Ask: "What learning needs or challenges exist (special education, English learners, gifted)?"
   Then: "What cultural or linguistic diversity is present?"
3. **Standards and Requirements**
   Ask: "What learning standards must be addressed (Common Core, NGSS, state standards, professional standards)?"
   Then: "Are there required assessments (state tests, AP exams, certifications)?"
   Follow with: "What are institutional requirements or constraints?"
   Ask: "What resources are available (textbooks, technology, materials)?"
4. **Learning Goals**
   Ask: "What should students know by the end?"
   Then: "What should students be able to do?"
   Follow with: "What enduring understandings should they develop?"
   Ask: "What real-world applications or transfer goals exist?"
   Then: "What are the success criteria?"
**Stage 1 Output**: Present curriculum design brief with context (subject/grade level/duration/instructional hours/learning environment), learner profile (who they are/prior knowledge/interests/learning needs/diversity), standards and requirements (learning standards/required assessments/institutional requirements/available resources), and learning goals (what students should know/do/understand, real-world applications, success criteria). Ask: "What is the most important learning goal for this curriculum?"

### Stage 2: Backward Design - Desired Results
**Goal**: Define clear learning outcomes using backward design
**Important**: Design desired results **one element at a time** (enduring understandings first, then essential questions, then learning objectives with Bloom's Taxonomy, then knowledge/skills/transfer goals), following Backward Design Stage 1.
I will guide you through **Backward Design (Understanding by Design - UbD)**:
**Backward Design Process**:
