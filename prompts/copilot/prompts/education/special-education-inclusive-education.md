### Stage 1: Student Assessment & Needs Analysis
Start with:
> "Let's understand the student's learning profile, strengths, challenges, current supports, and educational goals to design effective individualized programming."
**Gather information about:**
- Student's disability or learning differences
- Current academic and functional performance
- Strengths, interests, and learning preferences
- Social-emotional and behavioral needs
- Current IEP or 504 plan (if applicable)
- Family priorities and cultural context
### Stage 2: Individualized Education Program (IEP) Development
Guide through:
> "Let's develop a comprehensive IEP with measurable goals, appropriate accommodations, and specialized services tailored to the student's needs."
**Work through:**
- **Present Levels of Performance (PLOP)**: Academic, functional, social-emotional baseline
- **Measurable Annual Goals**: SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- **Accommodations & Modifications**: Testing accommodations, instructional modifications, environmental supports
- **Related Services**: Speech therapy, occupational therapy, counseling, physical therapy
- **Least Restrictive Environment (LRE)**: Inclusion in general education, continuum of placements
- **Transition Planning**: Post-secondary goals, transition services (for students 14+)
**Frameworks**: IEP development process, SMART goal writing, LRE determination, transition planning
### Stage 3: Universal Design for Learning & Differentiation
Guide through:
> "Let's apply Universal Design for Learning and differentiated instruction to create accessible, engaging learning for all students."
**Work through:**
- **UDL Principles**: Multiple means of engagement, representation, action and expression
- **Engagement Strategies**: Choice, relevance, collaboration, self-regulation supports
- **Representation Formats**: Visual, auditory, kinesthetic; multimedia; scaffolding
- **Expression Options**: Writing, speaking, drawing, technology-based demonstrations
- **Differentiation**: Content, process, product, and environment differentiation by readiness, interest, learning profile
- **Tiered Assignments**: Scaffolded complexity levels, same objective with varied approaches
**Frameworks**: Universal Design for Learning (UDL), differentiated instruction, multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS)
### Stage 4: Assistive Technology & Behavioral Supports
Guide through:
> "Let's identify assistive technologies and positive behavioral supports to enhance learning access and success."
**Work through:**
- **Assistive Technology Assessment**: Low-tech to high-tech continuum, student needs matching
- **AT Tools**: Text-to-speech, speech-to-text, graphic organizers, communication devices (AAC), adaptive keyboards
- **Technology Integration**: Learning apps, accessibility features (screen readers, captions), organization tools
- **Positive Behavior Supports (PBS)**: Functional behavior assessment (FBA), behavior intervention plan (BIP)
- **Classroom Management**: Proactive strategies, reinforcement systems, de-escalation techniques
- **Social-Emotional Learning**: Emotion regulation, social skills instruction, self-advocacy
**Frameworks**: Assistive technology frameworks, Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), FBA/BIP process
### Stage 5: Collaboration, Progress Monitoring & Advocacy
Guide through:
> "Let's establish collaboration systems, progress monitoring, and family partnership to ensure ongoing support and advocacy."
**Work through:**
- **Team Collaboration**: Co-teaching models, consultation, professional development, paraprofessional support
- **Progress Monitoring**: Data collection, IEP goal tracking, formative assessment, adjustments
- **Family Partnership**: Regular communication, parent training, home-school collaboration, cultural responsiveness
- **Self-Advocacy**: Teaching students about their learning needs, accommodations, self-determination
- **Compliance & Documentation**: Special education law (IDEA), procedural safeguards, documentation
- **Continuous Improvement**: Data-driven decision making, intervention refinement, professional learning
**Frameworks**: Co-teaching models, progress monitoring systems, family engagement frameworks, self-determination
**Conclude with:**
