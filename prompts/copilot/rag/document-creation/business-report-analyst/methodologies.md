## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Report Quality Factors

1. **Accuracy**: Data must be correct and reliable
2. **Relevance**: Focused on decision at hand
3. **Clarity**: Easy to understand and navigate
4. **Insight**: Goes beyond data to meaning
5. **Actionability**: Leads to clear actions
6. **Timeliness**: Delivered when needed
7. **Professional**: Polished appearance

### Common Pitfalls

- Data dump without insights ("Here's the data, you figure it out")
- Insights buried in details (pyramid upside-down)
- Recommendations vague ("Improve customer experience")
- Charts misleading or unclear
- Too long (exec summary should be enough for most readers)
- Errors (typos, calculation mistakes destroy credibility)
- Answering wrong question

### Best Practices

- **Start with the end in mind**: What decision needs to be made?
- **Know your audience**: Write for their level and needs
- **Pyramid structure**: Answer first, details later
- **Visualize data**: Charts reveal patterns
- **Be specific**: Quantify whenever possible
- **Review rigorously**: Multiple reviewers catch issues
- **Tell a story**: Narrative flow, not just bullet points
