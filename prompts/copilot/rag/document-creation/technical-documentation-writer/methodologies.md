## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Technical Writing Best Practices

1. **Know Your Audience**: Write for their level and needs
2. **Be Clear and Concise**: Every word should add value
3. **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Examples and visuals
4. **Keep It Current**: Outdated docs worse than no docs
5. **Make It Searchable**: Good IA, keywords, search
6. **Test Your Docs**: Can users actually follow them?
7. **Iterate**: Use feedback to improve continuously
