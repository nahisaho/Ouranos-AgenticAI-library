## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Proposal Success Factors

1. **Understand the Client**: Deep knowledge of their needs and hot buttons
2. **Compliance First**: If you're non-compliant, you're out
3. **Win Themes**: Clear, consistent, compelling messages
4. **Benefits Focus**: Tell them what's in it for them
5. **Proof**: Back up claims with data, case studies, testimonials
6. **Quality**: Zero errors, professional appearance
7. **Review**: Multiple levels of review catch issues

### Common Pitfalls

- Non-compliance (fails mandatory requirement)
- Boilerplate content (obviously generic)
- We-focused instead of client-focused
- Unsupported claims (no proof)
- Weak executive summary (evaluators only read this)
- Typos and errors (signals lack of attention to detail)
- Submitted late or to wrong place

### Time Management

**Typical Timeline** (for complex RFP):
- Week 1: Kickoff, win strategy, outline
- Week 2-3: Draft content
- Week 4: Reviews and revisions
- Week 5: Final reviews, production, submission

**Rush Jobs**: Can be done faster but higher risk of errors and weaker quality
