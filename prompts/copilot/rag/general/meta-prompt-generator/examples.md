### Full Dialogue Walkthrough

#### Stage 1: Clarifying Objectives

**AI**: "What is the ultimate goal you want to achieve with this prompt?"

**User**: "I want to create an AI prompt that helps with corporate strategy planning."

**AI**: "What specific deliverables or outputs do you expect? Who will be using this and for what purpose?"

**User**: "Business owners of small to medium-sized companies will use this. I want them to get an actionable strategy document they can actually implement."

**AI**: "Why is this task needed now? What problem are you trying to solve? What challenges or constraints are you facing? Have you tried any approaches before and what were the results?"

**User**: "My clients struggle to create comprehensive strategies. They're great at execution but weak at strategic planning. I've tried giving them templates, but they don't know how to fill them out properly. They need guidance through the process."

**AI**: "What would success look like for this prompt? Are there specific metrics (quantitative or qualitative) you'll use to measure success?"

**User**: "Success would be a client completing a full strategy document in 2-3 sessions, with clear goals, market analysis, and action plans. Qualitatively, they should understand *why* each section matters, not just fill in boxes."

**AI (Stage 1 Summary)**: "Let me summarize: You want to create a guided AI prompt that helps small-medium business owners (especially in B2B SaaS) develop comprehensive, actionable strategy documents through an educational process that teaches strategic thinking, not just template filling. Success means they complete a full strategy in 2-3 sessions and understand the reasoning behind each component. Is this correct?"

**User**: "Yes, exactly!"

---

#### Stage 2: Gathering Context Information

**AI**: "Which specialized field or domain does this relate to? Are there industry-specific terms, conventions, or standards I should know about? What level of domain expertise should the AI demonstrate?"

**User**: "B2B SaaS industry. The AI should understand terms like MRR, CAC, LTV, product-market fit, but explain them when first introduced. Expertise level should be intermediate - sophisticated enough to be credible, but accessible."

**AI**: "Who will be the primary users of this prompt? What is their background or expertise level in this domain? What are their specific needs and expectations?"

**User**: "Business owners and founders with 2-10 years experience running their companies. They're operationally strong but haven't done formal strategic planning. They're busy, so they need efficiency. They're skeptical of theory without practical application."

**AI**: "Are there any important constraints I should be aware of: time, resource, or technical limitations? Are there ethical, legal, or regulatory considerations?"

**User**: "Time constraint is big - they can't spend weeks on this. Each session should be 45-60 minutes. No special ethical concerns beyond standard business ethics. They'll want to keep strategic information confidential."

**AI**: "Do you have any reference materials, frameworks, or existing approaches you'd like to incorporate? Are there templates or best practices you want to follow?"

**User**: "I'd like to incorporate classic frameworks like SWOT, PEST, Porter's Five Forces, and Value Chain Analysis. I have a strategy document template I currently use, but I'm open to improving it."

**AI (Stage 2 Summary)**: "Let me structure what we've discussed:

**Domain**: B2B SaaS, intermediate expertise level
**Users**: Business owners/founders (2-10 years experience), operationally strong, limited formal strategy experience, busy and practical-minded
**Constraints**: 
- Time: 45-60 minute sessions
- Need for confidentiality
- Preference for practical over theoretical
**Existing Resources**: Classic frameworks (SWOT, PEST, Porter's Five Forces, Value Chain), current strategy template

Does this capture the context accurately?"

**User**: "Perfect!"

---

#### Stage 3: Applying Expertise and Frameworks

**AI**: "Based on your objectives, here are some frameworks that could be valuable:

1. **SWOT Analysis**: Systematically assess internal strengths/weaknesses and external opportunities/threats
2. **PEST(EL) Analysis**: Understand macro-environmental factors (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal)
3. **Porter's Five Forces**: Analyze competitive dynamics and industry attractiveness
4. **Value Chain Analysis**: Map value-creating activities from supplier to customer
5. **Business Model Canvas**: Visualize key business components in one framework
6. **OKR (Objectives and Key Results)**: Set measurable strategic goals

Which of these frameworks resonate with you? Or are there others you'd like to include? Would you like me to explain any of these frameworks in more detail?"

**User**: "SWOT, PEST, Porter's Five Forces, and Value Chain are must-haves. I'd like to include Business Model Canvas too. Can you explain how Business Model Canvas would fit?"

**AI**: "The Business Model Canvas provides a one-page visual overview of the entire business model, covering nine elements: customer segments, value propositions, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure. It's excellent for B2B SaaS because it forces clarity on how you create, deliver, and capture value. It would work well as a synthesis tool after the analytical frameworks, helping translate analysis into a coherent business model. Does that fit your vision?"

**User**: "Yes, that's perfect! Include all five frameworks."

**AI**: "How would you like to integrate these frameworks: used sequentially (one after another in different stages), used in parallel (combined within the same stage), or used selectively (user chooses based on their specific situation)? What should be the role of each framework in the overall process?"

**User**: "Sequential makes most sense. Start with external analysis (PEST, Porter's Five Forces), then internal (Value Chain, SWOT), then synthesize into Business Model Canvas. Each builds on the previous."

**AI**: "Excellent approach. How many dialogue stages would work best for this prompt? Typical prompts have 5 stages, simpler topics might use 3-4 stages, complex topics might need 6-7 stages. What should be the focus of each stage?"

**User**: "I'm thinking 6 stages:
1. Understand current business state
2. External environment (PEST + Porter's)
3. Internal capabilities (Value Chain)
4. SWOT synthesis
5. Business Model Canvas
6. Action planning

Is that too many?"

**AI**: "Not at all - that's appropriate for this complexity. Six stages allow proper depth without overwhelming users in single sessions. The flow is logical and each stage has clear focus. What output format would be most useful - report, action plan, analysis document, or something else?"

**User**: "A comprehensive strategy document with: executive summary, environmental analysis section, internal assessment, SWOT matrix, business model canvas visualization, and 90-day action plan."

**AI (Stage 3 Summary)**: "Here's the complete framework integration plan:

**Frameworks**: SWOT, PEST, Porter's Five Forces, Value Chain Analysis, Business Model Canvas
**Integration**: Sequential - External → Internal → Synthesis → Action
**Structure**: 6 dialogue stages
  1. Current Business State Assessment
  2. External Environment Analysis (PEST + Porter's Five Forces)
  3. Internal Capability Analysis (Value Chain)
  4. SWOT Synthesis
  5. Business Model Canvas Development
  6. Action Planning

**Output Format**: Strategy document with:
- Executive Summary
- Environmental Analysis
- Internal Assessment
- SWOT Matrix
- Business Model Canvas
- 90-Day Action Plan

Does this structure align with your vision? Any adjustments needed?"

**User**: "This is exactly what I envisioned!"

---

#### Stage 4: Generating the Meta-Prompt

**AI**: "Should the generated meta-prompt use a **one-question-at-a-time dialogue approach** (like this conversation) or present multiple questions per stage? Note: One-question-at-a-time approach ensures thorough understanding and natural conversation flow, while multiple questions per stage is more efficient but may be less engaging."

**User**: "One-question-at-a-time. My clients need the guidance and reflection time."

**AI**: "Are there any special features or sections you want included: examples and use cases, best practices and pitfalls to avoid, specific templates or formats, or industry-specific considerations?"

**User**: "Yes! Include:
- B2B SaaS-specific examples for each framework
- Common pitfalls to avoid (I see clients make the same mistakes repeatedly)
- Best practices from successful strategy planning
- Industry benchmarks where relevant (e.g., typical CAC:LTV ratios)"

**AI**: "Before I generate the complete meta-prompt, let me summarize what we've designed:

**Meta-Prompt for**: B2B SaaS Strategy Consultant
**Target Users**: Business owners/founders, 2-10 years experience, busy and practical
**Approach**: One-question-at-a-time dialogue across 6 stages
**Frameworks**: PEST → Porter's Five Forces → Value Chain → SWOT → Business Model Canvas
**Output**: Comprehensive strategy document with executive summary, analysis sections, and 90-day action plan
**Special Features**: B2B SaaS-specific examples, common pitfalls, best practices, industry benchmarks
**Time**: Designed for 45-60 minute sessions

Does everything look good, or would you like to adjust anything?"

**User**: "Looks perfect! Let's generate it."

**AI**: "I've generated the complete meta-prompt. Here's the structure:

[Generated meta-prompt would appear here - see 'Generated Output Example' section below]

Does this meta-prompt fulfill all your requirements and objectives?"

**User**: "This is excellent! Exactly what I needed."

**AI**: "What filename would you like for this prompt? I'd suggest: `b2b-saas-strategy-consultant.md`"

**User**: "Perfect!"

**AI**: "Great! Your meta-prompt is ready to use. The file `b2b-saas-strategy-consultant.md` is now available. Would you like me to explain any specific section or make any adjustments?"

**User**: "No, this is great. Thank you!"

## Dialogue Quality Tips

### Creating Natural Flow

**Good Example** (natural, conversational):
```
AI: "What industry is your business in?"
User: "Healthcare technology"
AI: "Interesting! What specific area of healthcare tech - is it patient care,
    hospital operations, medical devices, or something else?"
```

**Poor Example** (robotic, interrogative):
```
AI: "What industry is your business in?"
User: "Healthcare technology"
AI: "What area of healthcare technology?"
```

### Building on Responses

**Good Example** (acknowledges and builds):
```
User: "We're seeing high churn in our enterprise segment"
AI: "High enterprise churn is concerning given the typically higher acquisition costs.
    How long has this been happening, and do you have insight into why customers
    are leaving?"
```

**Poor Example** (ignores context):
```
User: "We're seeing high churn in our enterprise segment"
AI: "What is your churn rate?"
```

### Showing Expertise

**Good Example** (demonstrates domain knowledge):
```
AI: "For B2B SaaS, a CAC:LTV ratio of 1:3 is generally healthy, meaning you should
    recover acquisition costs and generate 3x value over customer lifetime. What's
    your current ratio, and are you satisfied with it?"
```

**Poor Example** (generic):
```
AI: "What is your customer acquisition cost?"
```
