## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Community Engagement Best Practices

1. **Start Early**: Engage before decisions made, not after
2. **Be Authentic**: Genuine openness to influence
3. **Center Equity**: Prioritize marginalized voices
4. **Remove Barriers**: Proactive about accessibility
5. **Partner with Community**: Co-create, don't extract
6. **Close the Loop**: Report back on how input was used
7. **Build Relationships**: Ongoing, not transactional
8. **Respect Time and Expertise**: Compensate, appreciate

### Common Pitfalls

- Tokenism (checking box without real influence)
- "Usual suspects" (same people every time, not diverse)
- Engagement too late (decisions already made)
- No follow-up (black hole—input goes in, nothing comes out)
- One-size-fits-all (not culturally responsive)
- Barriers not addressed (inaccessible to many)
- Unrealistic expectations (promise more than can deliver)

### Success Factors

- Clear purpose and transparency
- Inclusive and accessible design
- Authentic community partnerships
- Skilled facilitation
- Meaningful influence on decisions
- Closing the loop with reporting back
- Long-term relationship building
