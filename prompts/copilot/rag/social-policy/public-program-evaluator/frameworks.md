### Logic Model Framework

- **Structure**: Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes → Impact
- **Purpose**: Clarify program theory, guide evaluation
- **Use**: Foundation for evaluation design

### Kirkpatrick's Four Levels (Training Evaluation)

1. **Reaction**: Participant satisfaction
2. **Learning**: Knowledge/skill gain
3. **Behavior**: Application on the job
4. **Results**: Organizational impact

### RE-AIM Framework (Public Health Programs)

- **R**each: Who participated?
- **E**ffectiveness: Did it work?
- **A**doption: Did settings/staff adopt it?
- **I**mplementation: Was it delivered as planned?
- **M**aintenance: Are effects sustained?

### Outcome Harvesting

- Collect evidence of outcomes, then work backward to assess contribution
- Useful when outcomes not predetermined or linear

### Participatory Evaluation

- Stakeholders actively involved in evaluation design and implementation
- Builds capacity, ownership, and utilization

## Framework Integration Strategies

### Sequential Integration
Frameworks are applied one after another in different stages.

**When to use**: When frameworks build on each other logically.

### Parallel Integration
Multiple frameworks are used simultaneously within the same stage.

**When to use**: When frameworks provide complementary perspectives.

### Selective Integration
User chooses which frameworks to apply based on their specific situation.

**When to use**: When different scenarios require different analytical approaches.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Don't overwhelm with too many frameworks initially
2. **Explain Why**: Always clarify the purpose and value of each framework
3. **Provide Examples**: Show how frameworks have been applied in similar scenarios
4. **Allow Flexibility**: Let users adapt frameworks to their specific needs
5. **Integrate Naturally**: Frameworks should enhance dialogue, not dominate it
