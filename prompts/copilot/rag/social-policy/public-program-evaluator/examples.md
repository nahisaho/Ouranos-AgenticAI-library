### Scenario: Evaluating After-School STEM Program for Middle School Girls

**Stage 1: Purpose and Understanding**

**Program**: 
- After-school STEM program, 2 days/week, 20 weeks
- Target: 100 middle school girls from underrepresented backgrounds
- Goal: Increase interest and confidence in STEM, improve academic performance

**Evaluation Purpose**: Summative (assess effectiveness) + Formative (identify improvements)

**Key Questions**:
1. Did participants increase STEM interest and confidence?
2. Did STEM academic performance improve?
3. Was program implemented with fidelity and quality?
4. What factors facilitated or hindered success?

**Stage 2: Logic Model**

**Outcomes**:
- Short-term: STEM interest, self-efficacy, knowledge
- Medium-term: STEM grades, course-taking (advanced classes)
- Long-term: STEM career aspirations, college STEM majors

**Indicators**:
- STEM interest scale (pre-post)
- STEM self-efficacy scale
- STEM GPA
- % enrolling in advanced STEM courses

**Stage 3: Evaluation Design**

**Design**: Pre-post with matched comparison group
- Program participants (n=100)
- Comparison: Girls at similar schools not in program (n=100), matched on baseline GPA, demographics

**Data Collection**:
- Surveys: Pre, post, 6-month follow-up (interest, self-efficacy)
- Academic data: Grades, course enrollment (from school records)
- Observations: Program quality (10 sessions observed)
- Interviews: 20 participants, 5 staff, 5 parents

**Stage 4: Analysis and Findings**

**Quantitative Results**:
- STEM interest increased significantly (Cohen's d = 0.65, medium-large effect)
- Self-efficacy increased (d = 0.58)
- STEM GPA improved: Program +0.4 vs. Comparison +0.1 (p<.05)
- 45% of program participants enrolled in advanced STEM vs. 25% comparison (p<.01)

**Qualitative Findings**:
- Role models (female STEM professionals) highly impactful
- Hands-on projects increased engagement
- Peer support created safe environment to try
- Transportation barrier for some (20% attendance issues)

**Stage 5: Report and Recommendations**

**Conclusions**: Program effective at increasing STEM interest, confidence, and academic outcomes

**Recommendations**:
1. **High Priority**: Address transportation barrier (provide shuttle or bus passes)
2. **High Priority**: Expand role model visits (finding: most cited as impactful)
3. **Medium Priority**: Add parent engagement component (finding: parent support varied)
4. **Consider expansion**: Strong outcomes support scaling to additional schools

**Dissemination**: 
- Report to funder and school district
- Presentation at school board meeting
- Summary sent to parents
- Findings presented at education conference
