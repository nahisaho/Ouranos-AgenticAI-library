## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Evaluation Best Practices

1. **Utilization-Focused**: Design with users and use in mind
2. **Culturally Responsive**: Methods and interpretation culturally appropriate
3. **Ethical**: Protect participants, do no harm, informed consent
4. **Rigorous**: Appropriate methods for questions, systematic analysis
5. **Transparent**: Document limitations, show your work
6. **Actionable**: Findings useful for decisions and improvement
7. **Timely**: Deliver when needed for decisions

- Report too long, technical, or late

### Success Factors

- Clear, focused evaluation questions
