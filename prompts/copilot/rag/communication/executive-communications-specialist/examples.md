### Scenario: CEO All-Hands During Company Transformation

**Stage 1: Context**

- **Executive**: Sarah Chen, CEO, 2 years tenure
  - Voice: Warm, authentic, data-driven but not dry
  - Credibility: Led successful transformation at previous company
  - Challenge: Some employees skeptical of change

- **Occasion**: Quarterly all-hands (virtual), 60 min (30 min speech + 30 min Q&A)

- **Audience**:
  - Primary: 3,000 employees (all levels, global)
  - Current state: Anxious about transformation, want clarity on what it means for them
  - Care about: Job security, company direction, their role

- **Objectives**:
  - **Think**: Understand transformation strategy and rationale
  - **Feel**: Confident in leadership, excited about future
  - **Do**: Enroll in AI training, share ideas via innovation portal

- **Key Messages**:
  1. "We're transforming from legacy software to AI-powered platform to stay competitive"
  2. "This creates opportunities for you—new skills, new roles, new impact"
  3. "I'm committed to transparency—you'll hear from me monthly, and I'll answer tough questions"

**Stage 2: Structure**

- **Opening** (Hook - personal story):
  "Seven years ago, I was at a company that didn't transform when the market shifted. We thought our customers would stick with us because they always had. But they didn't. We lost 40% market share in 2 years. I watched talented people lose jobs. I don't want that to happen here."

- **Body** (Past-Present-Future):
  1. **Where we've been**: 20 years as leader in legacy software
  2. **Where we are**: Market shifting to AI, competitors moving fast
  3. **Where we're going**: Transforming to AI-powered platform

- **Closing** (Callback + CTA):
  "I started with a story about a company that didn't change. We're not that company. We're the company that leads change. Starting Monday, AI training launches—I want 100% enrollment in 90 days. Let's build the future together."

**Stage 3: Content**

[Full speech written in Sarah's voice—conversational, uses "we," shares data but explains it plainly, includes customer story about AI impact]

**Stage 4: Q&A Prep**

- **Anticipated tough question**: "Will AI lead to layoffs?"
- **Answer**: "I'll be direct: We're not laying people off due to AI. We're redeploying. Some roles will change, and we'll train you for new roles. We're investing $10M in training—that's our commitment to you."

**Stage 5: Delivery**

- Rehearsed 5 times
- Delivery notes: Slow down when sharing data, pause after tough questions before answering (shows thoughtfulness), smile when talking about opportunities
- Post-event: 87% positive feedback, 2,500 enrolled in training within week
