## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Executive Communications Best Practices

1. **Authenticity > Polish**: Sound like a real person, not a corporate robot
2. **Clarity > Complexity**: Simple language, clear structure
3. **Stories > Stats**: Data informs, stories persuade
4. **Empathy Matters**: Acknowledge audience concerns and feelings
5. **Brevity is Power**: Say more with less—respect audience time
6. **Prepare for Q&A**: Toughest questions reveal character
7. **Practice Matters**: Confidence comes from preparation

### Common Pitfalls

- No clear call to action (audience doesn't know what to do)
