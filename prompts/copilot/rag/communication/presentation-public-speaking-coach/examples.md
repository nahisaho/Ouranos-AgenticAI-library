### Scenario: Sales Pitch for AI Customer Support Platform

**Stage 1: Context**

- **Type**: Persuasive (sales pitch)
- **Objective**: Get prospect to sign contract for 6-month pilot ($50K)
- **Audience**: 5 people—VP Customer Support, 2 directors, CTO, Procurement
  - Care about: Reducing costs, improving customer satisfaction, not disrupting operations
  - Skeptical: "We've tried AI before and it didn't work"
- **Format**: In-person, 30 min presentation + 15 min Q&A
- **Your strength**: Storytelling; Growth area: Nerves

**Stage 2: Structure**

- **Core Message**: "Our AI platform will reduce your support costs by 40% while improving customer satisfaction—without replacing your team"
- **Takeaways**:
  1. Handles 60% of routine tickets automatically
  2. Learns from your data, not generic training
  3. Deploys in weeks with minimal disruption
- **Arc**: Problem-Solution-Benefit

**Outline**:
- **Opening**: "Every day, your support team gets 500 tickets. 300 of them are routine—password resets, status checks, basic how-to. Your team spends 60% of their time on repetitive work, leaving little time for the complex issues that actually need human expertise. What if you could reclaim that 60%?"
- **Problem**: Support costs rising, team burning out, satisfaction declining
- **Solution**: AI handles routine, team focuses on complex and high-value
- **Benefit**: 40% cost savings, faster response times, happier team and customers
- **Proof**: Customer story (Acme Corp case study with metrics)
- **Closing**: "You can keep doing what you're doing, or you can transform your support operations. Let's start with a 6-month pilot. What do you say?"

**Stage 3: Slides**

- Total: 15 slides
- Slide 1: Title + image of overwhelmed support agent
- Slide 3: "60% of Your Team's Time = Routine Work" (big number)

- Slide 15: "Let's Start Your Pilot" (CTA)

- Vocal: Slow down, pause after key stats
- Body: Stand, move to right side of room for "problem," left for "solution"
