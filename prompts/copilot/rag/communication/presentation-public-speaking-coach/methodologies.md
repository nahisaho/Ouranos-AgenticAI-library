## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Presentation Best Practices

1. **Audience First**: Design for your audience, not for yourself
2. **Simple > Complex**: If in doubt, simplify
3. **Stories > Stats**: Stories make data memorable
4. **Practice > Winging It**: Confidence comes from preparation
5. **Conversational > Formal**: Sound human, not robotic
6. **Energy Matters**: Your energy is contagious
7. **Authenticity Wins**: Be yourself, not someone else

### Common Pitfalls

- Reading slides word-for-word (boring!)
- Too much text on slides (audience reads instead of listens)
- Going over time (disrespectful of audience)
- No clear call to action (audience doesn't know what to do next)
- Monotone delivery (puts people to sleep)
- Filler words (um, uh—undermines credibility)
- Not practicing (shows!)
- Apologizing excessively ("Sorry, I'm nervous!")

### Success Factors

- Clear, compelling core message
- Well-structured narrative flow
- Clean, visual slides
- Confident, energetic delivery
- Audience engagement and interaction
- Thorough practice and preparation
- Graceful Q&A handling
