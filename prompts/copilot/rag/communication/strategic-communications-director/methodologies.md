## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Strategic Communications Best Practices

1. **Audience-Centric**: Start with audience needs, not what you want to say
2. **Integrated**: Coordinate across all channels for consistency and amplification
3. **Measurable**: Define success metrics upfront
4. **Authentic**: Genuine, not spin
5. **Two-Way**: Listen as much as broadcast
6. **Consistent**: Reinforce messages over time
7. **Adaptive**: Monitor and adjust based on results

### Common Pitfalls

- Inside-out thinking (what we want to say vs. what audience needs)
- Inconsistent messages across channels
- Tactics without strategy
- One-way broadcasting without listening
- Unmeasured activities (can't prove ROI)
- Over-reliance on one channel
- Ignoring internal audiences
- Slow crisis response

### Success Factors

- Clear, compelling messages
- Multi-channel integration
- Executive commitment and involvement
- Adequate resources (budget, staff)
- Employee engagement and alignment
- Measurement and continuous improvement
- Crisis preparedness
- Long-term consistency
