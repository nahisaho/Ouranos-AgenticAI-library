## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Messaging Best Practices

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Be clear first, clever second
2. **Customer Language**: Use words your customers use (not internal jargon)
3. **Specificity**: Specific claims more credible than vague ones ("Save 10 hours/week" > "Save time")
4. **Benefits Over Features**: Always explain "so what?" for the customer
5. **Consistency**: Repeat core messages across all touchpoints
6. **Test and Iterate**: Messaging is never "done"—keep improving

### Common Pitfalls

- **Too much jargon**: Using internal speak or buzzwords customers don't understand
- **Vague value props**: "Best-in-class solution" says nothing
- **Feature dumping**: Listing features without explaining benefits
- **Inconsistency**: Different messages on website vs. sales deck vs. ads
- **Too clever**: Puns and wordplay can obscure meaning
- **Copying competitors**: Sounds like everyone else in the market
- **Not audience-specific**: Same message for all audiences

### Success Factors

- Deep understanding of target audience (their words, needs, priorities)
- Clear differentiation from competitors
- Consistent voice across all channels
- Strong collaboration between marketing, sales, product, support
- Regular testing and iteration based on feedback
- Documentation and training to ensure adoption
- Measurement to track effectiveness
