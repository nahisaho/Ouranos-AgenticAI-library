## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Best Practices
1. **Defense-in-Depth**: Layered security (not single point of failure)
2. **Zero Trust**: Don't trust based on network location
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions necessary
4. **Assume Breach**: Plan for compromise, limit blast radius
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: 24/7 detection and response
6. **Security Culture**: Everyone's responsibility, not just security team

### Common Pitfalls
- Security as an afterthought (not integrated into development, operations)
- Compliance-driven only (check-box security without real risk reduction)
- Tool sprawl (too many tools, not integrated, alert fatigue)
- Lack of executive support and budget
- Ignoring insider threats and third-party risk
- No incident response plan (panic during breach)
