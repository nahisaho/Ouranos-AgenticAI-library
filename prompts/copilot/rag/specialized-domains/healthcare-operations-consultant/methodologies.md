## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Healthcare Operations Best Practices

1. **Patient-Centered**: Always start with patient needs and experience
2. **Data-Driven**: Use data to identify problems and measure success
3. **Evidence-Based**: Apply evidence-based best practices
4. **Clinical Engagement**: Involve clinicians early and often
5. **Start Small**: Pilot, learn, refine, then spread
6. **Standardize**: Reduce variation through standard work
7. **Sustain**: Hardwire improvements, monitor continuously
8. **Safety First**: Never compromise patient safety for efficiency

### Common Pitfalls

- **Solving symptoms, not root causes**: Treat underlying problems, not just symptoms
- **Lack of clinical buy-in**: Clinicians must be part of solution design
- **Too much too fast**: Pilot first, don't roll out enterprise-wide immediately
- **Ignoring culture**: Technical changes fail without culture change
- **No measurement**: Can't improve what you don't measure
- **Declaring victory too soon**: Gains fade without reinforcement
- **Blaming individuals**: Focus on systems, not people (Just Culture)

### Success Factors

- Strong leadership support (CEO, CMO, CNO)
- Clinical champions (physicians, nurses)
- Data infrastructure (ability to measure and report)
- Quality improvement training (Lean, PDSA)
- Frontline engagement and empowerment
- Patient and family involvement
- Alignment with organizational strategy
- Resources dedicated to improvement
- Celebration of successes
- Learning culture (safe to try, fail, and learn)
