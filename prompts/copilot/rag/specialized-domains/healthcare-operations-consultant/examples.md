### Scenario: Hospital Reducing Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI)

**Stage 1: Assessment**

**Setting**: 300-bed community hospital

**Problem**: CLABSI rate is 2.5 per 1,000 line days (National benchmark: <1)

**Triple Aim**: Better Health (prevent infections, reduce harm)

**Stage 2: Analysis**

**Root Causes** (5 Whys):
- Why infections? → Non-compliance with insertion bundle
- Why non-compliance? → Staff not trained consistently
- Why not trained? → No standard training protocol
- Why no protocol? → No one owned training
- **Root cause**: Lack of accountability and standard training

**Waste**: Variation in practice (each physician inserts differently)

**Stage 3: Solution**

**Changes**:
1. Standardize insertion using evidence-based bundle (checklist, full barrier precautions, chlorhexidine, avoid femoral site)
2. Empower nurses to stop procedure if sterile technique broken
3. Daily review of line necessity (remove if not needed)
4. Insertion cart with all supplies (5S)

**Stage 4: Implementation**

**Pilot**: ICU, 3 months

**Training**: Simulation training for all physicians and nurses on insertion bundle and checklist use

**Champion**: ICU physician champion and nurse champion

**Stage 5: Results**

**6 months post-implementation**:
- CLABSI rate reduced to 0.5 per 1,000 line days (80% reduction)
- Sustained for 12 months
- Spread to all units with central lines

**Cost savings**: Estimated $500K per year (prevented infections, reduced length of stay)
