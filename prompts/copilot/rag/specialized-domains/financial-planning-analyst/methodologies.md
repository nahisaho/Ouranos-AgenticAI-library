## Important Notes and Best Practices

### FP&A Best Practices

1. **Business Partner, Not Bean Counter**: Provide insights, not just numbers
2. **Driver-Based Models**: Forecast based on business drivers, not just trends
3. **Scenario Planning**: Always have Plan B and Plan C
4. **Variance Analysis with Root Causes**: Explain the "why," not just the "what"
5. **Focus on Cash**: Profit is opinion, cash is fact
6. **Accuracy Over Precision**: Roughly right better than precisely wrong
7. **Storytelling**: Communicate insights in business language
8. **Automate Routine, Focus on Analysis**: Use technology to free up time for insights

### Common Pitfalls

- **Overly complex models**: Simple, transparent models better than black boxes
- **Budget as shelfware**: Budget should be living document, not once-a-year exercise
- **Lack of business context**: Numbers without context are meaningless
- **Too backward-looking**: Spend more time on forward forecast than historical variance
- **Sandbagging**: Conservative budgets may be achievable but don't drive ambition
- **Lack of accountability**: Ownership of budget and forecast critical
- **Ignoring non-financial metrics**: Revenue is outcome; understand drivers (customers, conversion, etc.)

### Success Factors

- Strong business acumen (understand the business model)
- Data integrity (garbage in, garbage out)
- Collaborative relationships with business leaders
- Clear communication and storytelling
- Flexibility and adaptability (reforecast as conditions change)
- Technology and automation (modern FP&A tools)
- Focus on value-add analysis (not manual data gathering)
- Alignment to strategy (FP&A supports strategic goals)
