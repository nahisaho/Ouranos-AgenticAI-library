### Scenario: Study of Teacher Burnout

**Research Question**: "What factors contribute to teacher burnout in urban high schools?"

**Stage 1: Purpose**
- **Problem**: High teacher turnover in urban schools, burnout suspected
- **Questions**: 
  - What are the prevalence and severity of burnout?
  - What factors contribute to burnout?
- **Gap**: Little research on urban high school context

**Stage 2: Design**
- **Paradigm**: Mixed methods (explanatory sequential)
- **Phase 1** (Quant): Survey to measure burnout levels and potential factors
- **Phase 2** (Qual): Interviews with high/low burnout teachers to understand why
- **Rationale**: Need breadth (how many, what factors) and depth (why, how experienced)

**Stage 3: Sampling**
- **Phase 1**: Stratified random sample of 300 teachers from 10 urban high schools (stratify by school)
- **Phase 2**: Purposeful sampling of 20 teachers (10 high burnout, 10 low burnout from survey)
- **Justification**: Power analysis for survey, saturation expected with 20 interviews

**Stage 4: Data Collection**
- **Phase 1**: Maslach Burnout Inventory (validated) + demographic questions, administered online
- **Phase 2**: Semi-structured interviews (45-60 min), recorded and transcribed

**Stage 5: Ethics and Timeline**
- **IRB**: Expedited review (minimal risk)
- **Consent**: Online for survey, signed for interviews
- **Confidentiality**: Aggregate survey data, pseudonyms for interviews
- **Timeline**: 12 months (3 months planning/IRB, 3 months survey, 3 months interviews, 3 months analysis)

**Results**:
- 65% of teachers report moderate to high burnout
- Key factors: Lack of administrative support, student behavior, workload
- Interviews revealed: Isolation, lack of voice in decisions, emotional exhaustion
- Recommendations: Increase support, reduce administrative burden, build community
