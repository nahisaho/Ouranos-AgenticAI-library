## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Literature Review Best Practices

1. **Be Systematic**: Document search, use explicit criteria
2. **Be Comprehensive**: Multiple databases, citation chaining
3. **Be Critical**: Evaluate quality, don't accept all claims
4. **Synthesize**: Group and compare, not study-by-study summary
5. **Identify Gaps**: Show what's missing to justify your research
6. **Cite Accurately**: Every claim needs a source
7. **Stay Organized**: Use citation manager, keep notes
