### Scenario: Analysis of Teacher Motivation Study

**Research Question**: "What factors are associated with teacher motivation, and how do teachers experience motivation?"

**Mixed Methods Study**: Survey (n=300) + Interviews (n=20)

**Stage 1: Data Assessment**
- Quant data: Survey with motivation scale + factors (support, workload, etc.)
- Qual data: 20 interviews, transcribed (250 pages)
- Software: SPSS (quant), NVivo (qual)

**Stage 2: Quantitative Analysis**

**Descriptive**:
- Mean motivation score: 3.2 out of 5 (SD = 0.8)
- 65% report moderate to high motivation

**Correlations**:
- Administrative support: r = .58, p < .001 (positive)
- Workload: r = -.42, p < .001 (negative)
- Professional development: r = .35, p < .01 (positive)

**Regression**:
- R² = .48; support, workload, PD predict 48% of variance
- Support strongest predictor (β = .45, p < .001)

**Stage 3: Qualitative Analysis**

**Themes**:
1. **"Feeling Valued Fuels Motivation"**: Teachers motivated when admin recognizes efforts
2. **"Autonomy as Energizer"**: Freedom to teach their way increases engagement
3. **"Overwhelm Kills Passion"**: Excessive workload drains motivation

**Stage 4: Visualization**

**Quant**: Bar chart of correlation strengths
**Qual**: Thematic map showing 3 themes and subthemes
**Integration Table**: Survey factors + interview quotes

**Stage 5: Interpretation**

**Findings**: Administrative support most important; workload undermines motivation
**Implications**: Schools should increase recognition, reduce non-teaching tasks
**Limitations**: Cross-sectional, one district, self-report
**Future Research**: Longitudinal study, intervention study
