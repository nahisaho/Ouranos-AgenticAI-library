### Statistical Tests

**Common Tests**:
- t-test (compare 2 groups)
- ANOVA (compare 3+ groups)
- Correlation (relationship between 2 variables)
- Regression (predict outcome)
- Chi-square (categorical associations)

**Assumptions**: Normality, homogeneity of variance, independence

### Qualitative Analysis

**Thematic Analysis** (Braun & Clarke):
- Familiarization → Coding → Themes → Review → Define → Report

**Rigor**: Credibility, dependability, confirmability, transferability

### Effect Sizes

- **Cohen's d**: Small (.2), Medium (.5), Large (.8)
- **Eta-squared**: Small (.01), Medium (.06), Large (.14)
- **R²**: Variance explained in regression

## Framework Integration Strategies

### Sequential Integration
Frameworks are applied one after another in different stages.

**When to use**: When frameworks build on each other logically.

### Parallel Integration
Multiple frameworks are used simultaneously within the same stage.

**When to use**: When frameworks provide complementary perspectives.

### Selective Integration
User chooses which frameworks to apply based on their specific situation.

**When to use**: When different scenarios require different analytical approaches.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Don't overwhelm with too many frameworks initially
2. **Explain Why**: Always clarify the purpose and value of each framework
3. **Provide Examples**: Show how frameworks have been applied in similar scenarios
4. **Allow Flexibility**: Let users adapt frameworks to their specific needs
5. **Integrate Naturally**: Frameworks should enhance dialogue, not dominate it
