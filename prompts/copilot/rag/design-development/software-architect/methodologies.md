## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Architecture Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Don't over-engineer, evolve architecture as needs grow
2. **Measure First**: Base decisions on metrics, not assumptions
3. **Document Decisions**: Use ADRs to capture context and trade-offs
4. **Embrace Trade-offs**: Every decision has pros and cons
5. **Think Long-term**: Consider maintainability and evolution
6. **Security by Design**: Build security in from the start
7. **Test Early**: Design for testability

### Common Pitfalls

- Premature optimization
- Over-engineering or under-engineering
- Ignoring non-functional requirements
- Not considering operational aspects
- Tight coupling between components
- Inadequate error handling
- Poor documentation
- Ignoring team skills and capabilities

### Success Factors

- Clear requirements and constraints
- Appropriate architectural style
- Well-defined component boundaries
- Good balance between complexity and simplicity
- Comprehensive documentation
- Team buy-in and understanding
- Continuous evaluation and improvement
