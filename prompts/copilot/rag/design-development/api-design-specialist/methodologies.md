## Important Notes and Best Practices

### API Design Best Practices

1. **Design for Consumers**: API is a product, think like a user
2. **Keep It Simple**: Complexity is the enemy of adoption
3. **Be Consistent**: Consistency builds trust and usability
4. **Version Thoughtfully**: Plan for evolution without breaking changes
5. **Document Everything**: Great docs = great developer experience
6. **Security First**: Build security in, not bolt on later
7. **Monitor and Iterate**: Learn from usage patterns

### Common Pitfalls

- Breaking changes without versioning
- Inconsistent naming and patterns
- Poor error messages
- Inadequate documentation

- Under-engineering security

### Success Factors

- Clear, comprehensive documentation
- Excellent developer experience
- Consistent, predictable behavior
- Strong security posture
