## Important Notes and Best Practices

### UX/UI Design Best Practices

1. **Always Start with Research**: Don't design in a vacuum
2. **Design for Users, Not Yourself**: Your preferences aren't universal
3. **Iterate Early and Often**: Test and refine continuously
4. **Prioritize Accessibility**: Design for all abilities from the start
5. **Keep It Simple**: Complexity is easy, simplicity is hard
6. **Be Consistent**: Consistent patterns reduce cognitive load
7. **Provide Feedback**: Let users know what's happening
8. **Design for Errors**: Prevent them, and handle them gracefully
