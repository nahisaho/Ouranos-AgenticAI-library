## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Technical Writing Best Practices

1. **Know Your Audience**: Write for their level and goals
2. **Start with Why**: Explain the value before the how
3. **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Use examples liberally
4. **Test Your Docs**: Can a new user actually follow them?
5. **Keep It Updated**: Outdated docs are worse than no docs
6. **Make It Searchable**: SEO and internal search matter
7. **Get Feedback**: Docs improve through iteration

### Common Pitfalls
