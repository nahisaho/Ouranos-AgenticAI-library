## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Coaching Best Practices

1. **Coach, Don't Consult**: Ask questions, don't give advice (mostly)
2. **Trust the Process**: The leader has the answers
3. **Hold Space**: Silence is powerful, let them think
4. **Challenge Assumptions**: What are they taking for granted?
