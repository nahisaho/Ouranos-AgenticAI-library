## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Sales Process Best Practices

1. **Qualification is Key**: Focus on right opportunities, not more opportunities
2. **Value over Features**: Sell business outcomes, not product features
3. **Buyer-Centric**: Align to buyer's journey, not your sales process
4. **Data-Driven**: Use metrics to diagnose and optimize
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Always be testing and learning
6. **Enablement Matters**: Equip team with tools and knowledge to succeed

### Common Sales Pitfalls

- Feature dumping (talking, not listening)
- Premature presenting (before understanding needs)
- Weak qualification (chasing unwinnable deals)

### Sales Success Factors

- Strong value proposition
