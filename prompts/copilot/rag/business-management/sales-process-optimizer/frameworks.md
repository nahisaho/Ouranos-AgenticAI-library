### Sales Funnel Optimization

**Principle**: Maximize volume × conversion × velocity at each stage

**Optimization Levers**:

1. **Increase Top of Funnel**:
   - Better lead generation
   - Wider targeting
   - More prospecting activity

2. **Improve Conversion Rates**:
   - Better qualification (focus on right opportunities)
   - Stronger value proposition
   - Improved sales skills
   - Better enablement content

3. **Accelerate Velocity**:
   - Remove friction and delays
   - Engage decision-makers earlier
   - Create urgency
   - Streamline processes

4. **Increase Deal Size**:
   - Upsell and cross-sell
   - Multi-product bundling
   - Value-based pricing
   - Target larger customers

**Waterfall Analysis**: Track cohorts through funnel over time

### BANT Framework Application

**Purpose**: Qualify opportunities to focus on winnable deals

**Scoring Approach**:

Each BANT element scored 0-2:
- 0 = Not present or unclear
- 1 = Partially present
- 2 = Fully present

**Total Score** (0-8):
- 7-8: High quality, prioritize
- 5-6: Medium quality, develop
- 0-4: Low quality, nurture or disqualify

**When to Use**: Early in sales process (SQL stage)

**Benefits**: Focus energy on best opportunities, improve win rate

### SPIN Selling Framework

**Purpose**: Uncover needs and build value through questions

**Question Progression**:

Early in conversation → Later in conversation
Situation → Problem → Implication → Need-Payoff

**Ratio**: 
- Fewer situation (only what's needed)
- More problem (uncover issues)
- Even more implication (build urgency)
- Most need-payoff (get buyer to articulate value)

**Application**: Discovery calls, needs analysis, qualification

### Sales Enablement Best Practices

**Content Creation**:
- Built with sales input
- Tested and refined based on usage
- Easy to customize
- Version controlled

**Adoption**:
- Train on how to use

## Best Practices
