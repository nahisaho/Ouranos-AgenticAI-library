## Important Notes and Best Practices

### CX Best Practices

1. **Outside-In Thinking**: Start with customer perspective, not internal view
2. **Research-Based**: Ground in actual customer data and insights
3. **End-to-End**: Consider entire journey, not just individual touchpoints
4. **Emotional Connection**: Recognize emotions drive loyalty more than rational factors
5. **Continuous**: CX is never done; iterate and improve continuously
6. **Cross-Functional**: CX requires collaboration across entire organization
