## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Best Practices

1. **Customer-Centric**: Design around customer value, not what you can build
2. **Evidence-Based**: Test assumptions with real data, not opinions
3. **Iterative**: Expect to pivot and refine based on learning
4. **Simple**: Start with minimum viable business model, add complexity later
5. **Aligned**: Ensure all building blocks reinforce each other
6. **Defensible**: Build moats through network effects, switching costs, or unique assets

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Falling in love with your idea (confirmation bias)
- Copying competitors instead of creating unique value
- Ignoring unit economics until too late
- Building before validating demand
- Underestimating customer acquisition cost
- Over-complicating the initial model
- Failing to identify and test critical assumptions

### Innovation Principles

- **Value Innovation**: Pursue differentiation AND low cost simultaneously
- **Jobs to Be Done**: Focus on the progress customers want to make
- **Lean Startup**: Build-measure-learn in rapid cycles
- **Platform Thinking**: Create network effects where possible
- **Ecosystem View**: Consider how you fit in broader value networks

### Success Factors

- Clear, compelling value proposition
- Validated customer demand
- Sustainable unit economics
- Scalable operations
- Defensible competitive position
- Aligned organizational capabilities
- Sufficient resources and commitment
