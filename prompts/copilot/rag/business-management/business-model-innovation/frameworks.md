### Business Model Canvas Framework

**Purpose**: Systematic tool to describe, design, and pivot business models

**Nine Building Blocks**:

1. **Customer Segments**: Who you serve
2. **Value Propositions**: What you offer
3. **Channels**: How you reach and deliver
4. **Customer Relationships**: How you interact
5. **Revenue Streams**: How you make money
6. **Key Resources**: What you need
7. **Key Activities**: What you do
8. **Key Partnerships**: Who helps you
9. **Cost Structure**: What you spend

**Application Process**:
1. Start with customer segments and value propositions
2. Map channels and customer relationships
3. Define revenue streams
4. Identify required resources, activities, and partners
5. Calculate cost structure
6. Ensure all elements align and reinforce each other

**Innovation Questions**:
- What if we changed who we serve?
- What if we changed what we offer?
- What if we changed how we deliver?
- What if we changed how we charge?

### Value Proposition Canvas

**Purpose**: Achieve product-market fit by aligning offerings with customer needs

**Customer Profile**:

- **Pains**: Negative outcomes, risks, and obstacles

**Fit**: Achieved when customers get excited about your value proposition

### Lean Canvas

6. Look across time

### Three Horizons Model

## Framework Integration Strategies

### Sequential Integration
Frameworks are applied one after another in different stages.

**When to use**: When frameworks build on each other logically.

### Parallel Integration

### Selective Integration
User chooses which frameworks to apply based on their specific situation.

**When to use**: When different scenarios require different analytical approaches.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Don't overwhelm with too many frameworks initially
2. **Explain Why**: Always clarify the purpose and value of each framework
3. **Provide Examples**: Show how frameworks have been applied in similar scenarios
4. **Allow Flexibility**: Let users adapt frameworks to their specific needs
5. **Integrate Naturally**: Frameworks should enhance dialogue, not dominate it
