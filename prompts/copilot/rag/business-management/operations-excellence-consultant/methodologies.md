## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Operational Excellence Mindset

1. **Data-Driven**: Decisions based on facts and data, not opinions ("In God we trust; all others bring data")
2. **Respect for People**: Frontline workers know the work best; engage them in improvement
3. **Go to Gemba**: Go to where work happens, observe reality, understand problems firsthand
4. **Customer Focus**: Define value from customer perspective; eliminate anything customer won't pay for
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Never satisfied with status quo; pursue perfection relentlessly
6. **Systems Thinking**: Optimize the whole, not just parts; beware of local optimization
7. **Standardize Then Improve**: You can't improve what isn't standardized; standardize current best practice, then improve it

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Tool Overload**
   - Don't apply every tool to every problem
   - Select methodology appropriate to problem type (Lean for waste/flow, Six Sigma for variation, TOC for throughput)
   - Start simple (5 Whys, 5S) before advanced tools (DMAIC, SPC)

2. **Improvement Theater**
   - Focusing on optics (pretty boards, 5S) without real operational impact
   - Measure actual improvements: quality, speed, cost, not just activity (Kaizen events held)

3. **Ignoring Culture**
   - Process changes without people changes fail
   - Build continuous improvement mindset: empowerment, idea systems, recognition, learning from failures

4. **Analysis Paralysis**
   - Endless data collection and analysis without action
   - Use PDSA: Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles; test quickly, learn, adapt

5. **Unsustained Improvements**
   - Improvements deteriorate without control mechanisms
   - Implement: standard work, audits, visual management, leader routines, reinforcement

6. **Local Optimization**
   - Improving one step but worsening overall system
   - Use value stream perspective; optimize flow, not individual steps
   - Beware of efficiency metrics that drive batching and inventory

7. **Lack of Leadership Commitment**
   - Leaders must visibly support, participate (Gemba walks), remove barriers
   - Allocate time and resources for improvement
   - Hold managers accountable for operational performance and improvement

### Success Factors

1. **Clear Business Case**: Link operational improvements to business outcomes (revenue, margin, customer satisfaction)
2. **Right Methodology for Problem**: Match tool to problem type
3. **Engaged Frontline**: Involve people doing the work; they have best ideas
4. **Quick Wins**: Build momentum and credibility early
5. **Standard Work**: Document and train on best practices
6. **Visual Management**: Make performance and problems visible
7. **Control and Audit**: Prevent backsliding through monitoring and reinforcement
8. **Leadership Involvement**: Gemba walks, reviews, barrier removal
9. **Capability Building**: Train Green Belts, Black Belts, Lean practitioners
10. **Continuous Improvement Culture**: Ideas, Kaizen events, learning from failure, relentless pursuit of better
