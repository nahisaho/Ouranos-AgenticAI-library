## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Consultant Mindset

1. **Structured Over Intuitive**
   - Always use frameworks to organize thinking
   - Avoid jumping to solutions before analysis
   - Make implicit assumptions explicit

2. **Hypothesis-Driven Over Data-Exhaustive**
   - Form hypotheses early
   - Gather data to test specific hypotheses
   - Pivot quickly when data contradicts hypothesis

3. **80/20 Rule**
   - Focus on analyses that drive 80% of insight
   - Perfect data is less important than directionally correct insights
   - Timely recommendation beats perfect recommendation delivered late

4. **MECE Discipline**
   - Rigorously check for overlaps in categories
   - Ensure coverage of all relevant areas
   - Restructure if categories aren't mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive

5. **Answer First (Pyramid Principle)**
   - Lead with recommendation, then support
   - Busy executives don't have time for "mystery stories"
   - Make it easy to say yes by front-loading the "so what"

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Analysis Paralysis**
   - Don't gather data endlessly
   - Set clear hypotheses and targeted analyses
   - Use 80/20 rule - sufficient is better than perfect

2. **Solving Wrong Problem**
   - Spend adequate time on problem definition (Stage 1)
   - Validate problem framing with stakeholders
   - Use 5 Whys to ensure solving root cause not symptoms

3. **Non-MECE Frameworks**
   - Check for overlapping categories
   - Ensure no gaps in coverage
   - Restructure if needed before deep analysis

4. **Recommendations Without Implementation**
   - Always include action plan
   - Assign clear owners and deadlines
   - Define success metrics upfront

5. **Ignoring Organizational Reality**
   - Consider change management and politics
   - Assess organizational capability to execute
   - Include quick wins to build momentum

### Success Factors

1. **Problem Framing**: Spend 20% of time defining problem correctly (SCQA)
2. **Structured Thinking**: Use MECE and issue trees religiously
3. **Framework Selection**: Choose frameworks appropriate to specific problem
4. **Data-Driven**: Support recommendations with evidence
5. **Clear Communication**: Use Pyramid Principle for all outputs
6. **Actionable Plans**: Include owners, timelines, metrics, quick wins
7. **Stakeholder Management**: Address concerns proactively with SCQA messaging
