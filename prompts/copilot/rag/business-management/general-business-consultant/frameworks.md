### MECE Principle (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

**Definition**: Problem-solving approach ensuring categories are:
- **Mutually Exclusive**: No overlap between categories
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: All possibilities covered

**Application**:
```
Problem: Sales declining

MECE breakdown:
- Existing customers (mutually exclusive from new customers)
  - Buying less frequently
  - Buying smaller amounts
  - Churning entirely
- New customer acquisition (mutually exclusive from existing)
  - Fewer new customers
  - Lower quality new customers

Non-MECE example (avoid):
- Product issues (could overlap with pricing)
- Pricing issues (could overlap with product)
- Customer service (could overlap with both)
```

### Issue Tree Analysis

**Purpose**: Break complex problems into manageable, structured components

**Structure**:
1. **Main Question** at top
2. **Major Questions** (2-4, following MECE)
3. **Sub-questions** under each major question (also MECE)
4. **Hypotheses** for each branch
5. **Data requirements** to test hypotheses

**Example**:
```
Why are profits declining?
├── Revenue declining?
│   ├── Volume down?
│   │   └── Hypothesis: Customer churn increased 15%
│   └── Price down?
│       └── Hypothesis: Competitive pressure forced 10% price cut
└── Costs increasing?
    ├── Variable costs up?
    └── Fixed costs up?
```

### Hypothesis-Driven Approach

**Process**:
1. **Form initial hypothesis** based on problem understanding
2. **Identify what data would prove/disprove** hypothesis
3. **Gather minimum data** needed to test
4. **Validate or invalidate** hypothesis
5. **Refine hypothesis** and repeat

**Benefits**:
- Focuses analysis on most likely answers
- Reduces time spent on exhaustive data gathering
- Creates testable, specific statements
- Enables fast pivoting when hypothesis invalidated

### Pyramid Principle

**Purpose**: Communicate recommendations clearly starting with answer

**Structure**:
```
Main Point (Answer first)
├── Supporting Reason 1
│   ├── Evidence 1a
│   └── Evidence 1b
├── Supporting Reason 2
│   ├── Evidence 2a
│   └── Evidence 2b
└── Supporting Reason 3
    ├── Evidence 3a
    └── Evidence 3b
```

**Rules**:
- Ideas at any level summarize ideas grouped below
- Ideas in each grouping are same type
- Ideas in each grouping logically ordered

### SCQA Framework

**Purpose**: Structure problem statements and executive communications

**Components**:
- **Situation**: Stable, accepted context (1-2 sentences)
- **Complication**: Problem, change, or question disrupting situation (1-2 sentences)
- **Question**: What needs to be answered (1 sentence)
- **Answer**: Recommended solution or key finding (2-3 sentences)

**Example**:
- S: "Company has been market leader in widgets for 10 years with 35% market share"
- C: "Over past 12 months, market share declined to 28% and revenue dropped 15%"
- Q: "What is causing market share loss and how can we regain leadership?"
- A: "Analysis shows competitors captured mid-market with 30% lower prices. Recommend launching value brand to compete in mid-market while protecting premium positioning, expected to recover 5% share in 12 months"

### Porter's Five Forces

**Purpose**: Analyze competitive dynamics in an industry

**Five Forces**:
1. **Threat of New Entrants**: Barriers to entry, capital requirements, economies of scale
2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: Supplier concentration, switching costs, input importance
3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**: Buyer concentration, price sensitivity, switching costs
4. **Threat of Substitutes**: Alternative products, relative price-performance, switching costs
5. **Competitive Rivalry**: Number of competitors, industry growth rate, differentiation

**Use When**: Assessing industry attractiveness, competitive positioning, strategic moves

### SWOT Analysis

**Purpose**: Assess internal capabilities and external environment

**Framework**:
- **Strengths** (Internal, Positive): Capabilities, resources, competitive advantages
- **Weaknesses** (Internal, Negative): Limitations, resource gaps, vulnerabilities
- **Opportunities** (External, Positive): Market trends, unmet needs, favorable changes
- **Threats** (External, Negative): Competition, regulatory changes, market shifts

**Best Practices**:
- Be specific (not "strong brand" but "95% brand recognition in target segment")
- Prioritize (focus on most important 3-5 in each quadrant)
- Link to strategy (SO: leverage strengths for opportunities, ST: use strengths to counter threats, WO: address weaknesses to capture opportunities, WT: defensive strategies)

### McKinsey 7S Framework

**Purpose**: Assess organizational effectiveness and guide change

**Seven Elements**:
- **Strategy**: Plan to achieve competitive advantage
- **Structure**: Organization design and reporting lines
- **Systems**: Processes, procedures, IT systems
- **Shared Values**: Core beliefs and culture (center of model)
- **Skills**: Capabilities and competencies
- **Style**: Leadership approach and management style
- **Staff**: People, talent, HR practices

**Key Insight**: All seven elements must be aligned for organizational effectiveness

### BCG Matrix (Growth-Share Matrix)

**Purpose**: Portfolio management and resource allocation across business units or product lines

**Framework**:
- **Stars** (High Growth, High Market Share): Invest to maintain leadership
- **Cash Cows** (Low Growth, High Market Share): Harvest profits, fund other units
- **Question Marks** (High Growth, Low Market Share): Invest selectively or divest
- **Dogs** (Low Growth, Low Market Share): Divest or harvest

**Application**: Plot each business unit/product on 2x2 matrix, determine resource allocation strategy

**Example**: SaaS company with enterprise product (cash cow generating 70% profit), small business product (question mark with 45% growth but 8% share), legacy on-premise (dog declining 5% annually)

### Ansoff Matrix (Product-Market Growth)

**Purpose**: Identify growth strategy options based on product and market dimensions

**Framework**:
- **Market Penetration** (Existing Product, Existing Market): Increase market share through better marketing, pricing, distribution
- **Market Development** (Existing Product, New Market): Enter new geographies, segments, or channels
- **Product Development** (New Product, Existing Market): Create new offerings for current customers
- **Diversification** (New Product, New Market): Highest risk, potentially highest reward

**Application**: Evaluate growth options systematically based on risk tolerance and capabilities

**Example**: Coffee chain considering: penetration (loyalty program), market development (airport locations), product development (ready-to-drink beverages), diversification (branded merchandise)

### Kano Model (Customer Satisfaction)

**Purpose**: Understand customer satisfaction drivers and prioritize features/investments

**Framework**:
- **Basic Needs** (Must-haves): Dissatisfaction if absent, no satisfaction if present (e.g., hotel cleanliness)
- **Performance Needs** (More is better): Satisfaction proportional to performance (e.g., internet speed)
- **Excitement Needs** (Delighters): High satisfaction if present, no dissatisfaction if absent (e.g., free upgrade)
- **Indifferent**: Customer doesn't care
- **Reverse**: Some customers prefer opposite

**Application**: Survey customers, classify features, invest in performance and excitement needs after covering basics

**Example**: Airline - basic (safety, on-time), performance (legroom, food quality), excitement (lie-flat seats, lounge access)

### VRIO Framework (Resource Analysis)

**Purpose**: Assess whether resources/capabilities create sustained competitive advantage

**Framework** - Four questions about each resource:
- **Valuable**: Does it enable firm to exploit opportunity or neutralize threat?
- **Rare**: Is it controlled by few firms?
- **Inimitable**: Is it costly for others to imitate?
- **Organized**: Is firm organized to capture value?

**Result**:
- No to Valuable → Competitive Disadvantage
- Yes-No-No-No → Competitive Parity
- Yes-Yes-No-No → Temporary Competitive Advantage
- Yes-Yes-Yes-Yes → Sustained Competitive Advantage

**Example**: Luxury brand heritage (valuable, rare, hard to imitate, well-organized) = sustained advantage; commodity manufacturing (valuable but common) = parity

### Scenario Planning

**Purpose**: Prepare for uncertain futures by developing multiple plausible scenarios

**Process**:
1. **Identify focal question** (e.g., "What will our industry look like in 2030?")
2. **List key drivers** of change (technology, regulation, customer behavior, economics)
3. **Identify critical uncertainties** (high impact, high uncertainty)
4. **Develop scenario logic** using 2x2 matrix of two critical uncertainties
5. **Flesh out scenarios** with narratives for each quadrant
6. **Identify implications** and strategies that work across scenarios (robust strategies) or specific to scenarios (contingent strategies)

**Example**: Retail scenarios based on "Speed of AI adoption" (x-axis) and "Economic growth" (y-axis) creating four worlds: "AI Boom," "Tech-Enabled Resilience," "Traditional Recovery," "Struggle Street"

### Critical Success Factors (CSF)

**Purpose**: Identify the limited number of areas where excellent performance is necessary for success

**Process**:
1. Define business objectives clearly
2. Identify 3-7 critical success factors (areas that must go right)
3. For each CSF, define measurable KPIs
4. Assess current performance against each CSF
5. Focus resources on CSFs

**Characteristics of good CSFs**:
- Limited in number (3-7)
- Measurable
- Achievable with effort
- Critical to success (not just important)

**Example**: E-commerce startup CSFs - Customer Acquisition Cost <$50 (vs. LTV $200), Site conversion rate >3%, Delivery within 48 hours 95%+ time, Product return rate <8%

### Balanced Scorecard

**Purpose**: Translate strategy into measurable objectives across four perspectives

**Framework**:
- **Financial Perspective**: How do we look to shareholders? (Revenue growth, profitability, ROI)
- **Customer Perspective**: How do customers see us? (Satisfaction, retention, market share)
- **Internal Process Perspective**: What must we excel at? (Quality, cycle time, innovation)
- **Learning & Growth Perspective**: Can we continue to improve? (Employee skills, systems, culture)

**Application**: For each perspective, define objectives → measures → targets → initiatives

**Example**: Tech company - Financial (30% revenue growth), Customer (NPS >50), Internal (release cycle <2 weeks), Learning (75% employees trained in AI)

### Root Cause Analysis (Fishbone/Ishikawa Diagram)

**Purpose**: Systematically identify potential root causes of a problem

**Framework** - Six categories of causes (6 Ms):
- **Methods**: Processes, procedures, policies
- **Machines**: Equipment, technology, tools
- **Materials**: Raw materials, supplies, information
- **Manpower**: People, skills, training, staffing
- **Measurement**: Metrics, data collection, inspection
- **Mother Nature/Environment**: Physical environment, external factors

**Process**:
1. State problem clearly (head of fish)
2. Draw six bones representing 6 Ms
3. Brainstorm potential causes for each category
4. Ask "why" for each cause to dig deeper (sub-bones)
5. Identify most likely root causes for investigation

**Example**: Manufacturing defect analysis - Methods (insufficient QC checkpoints), Machines (calibration drift), Materials (supplier quality variance), Manpower (inadequate training), Measurement (outdated gauges), Environment (temperature fluctuations)

### 5 Whys

**Purpose**: Find root cause by asking "why" iteratively

**Process**:
1. State the problem
2. Ask "Why did this happen?"
3. For each answer, ask "Why?" again
4. Repeat 5 times (or until root cause found)
5. Address root cause, not symptoms

**Example**:
- Problem: Customer churn increased
- Why? Customer satisfaction scores dropped
- Why? Support response time increased
- Why? Support team understaffed
- Why? Budget cuts reduced headcount
- Why? Revenue declined (root cause loop - need revenue recovery strategy)

## Framework Integration Strategies

### Sequential Integration
Frameworks are applied one after another in different stages.

**When to use**: When frameworks build on each other logically.

### Parallel Integration
Multiple frameworks are used simultaneously within the same stage.

**When to use**: When frameworks provide complementary perspectives.

### Selective Integration
User chooses which frameworks to apply based on their specific situation.

**When to use**: When different scenarios require different analytical approaches.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Don't overwhelm with too many frameworks initially
2. **Explain Why**: Always clarify the purpose and value of each framework
3. **Provide Examples**: Show how frameworks have been applied in similar scenarios
4. **Allow Flexibility**: Let users adapt frameworks to their specific needs
5. **Integrate Naturally**: Frameworks should enhance dialogue, not dominate it
