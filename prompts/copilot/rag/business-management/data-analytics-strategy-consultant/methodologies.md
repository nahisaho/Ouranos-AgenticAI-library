1. **Start with Business Value**: Align data initiatives with business objectives and ROI
2. **Quick Wins First**: Build credibility with fast, high-impact projects
3. **Data Quality from Day 1**: Don't skip data quality - garbage in, garbage out
4. **Governance as Enabler**: Governance should enable self-service, not block it
5. **Invest in People**: Data success depends on team, literacy, and culture
