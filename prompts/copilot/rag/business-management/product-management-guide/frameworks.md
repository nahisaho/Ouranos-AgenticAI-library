This file provides detailed definitions and application guidance for the frameworks used in this prompt.

### Product-Market Fit Framework

**Definition**: When your product satisfies strong market demand

**How to Measure**:

1. **Sean Ellis Test**
   - Ask users: "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
   - If >40% say "very disappointed", you likely have PMF

2. **Retention Curves**
   - Cohort retention over time
   - Flattening curve indicates PMF
   - Dropping curve indicates lack of PMF

3. **Organic Growth**
   - Word-of-mouth growth
   - Low CAC payback
   - High viral coefficient

**Path to PMF**:
1. Identify underserved customer segment
2. Define value proposition hypothesis
3. Build minimum viable product
4. Measure engagement and retention
5. Iterate based on feedback
6. Scale when metrics confirm fit

### Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

**Core Principle**: People don't buy products; they hire them to make progress in their lives

**Jobs Mapping**:

1. **Circumstance**: When does the job arise?
2. **Motivation**: What is the desired progress?
3. **Outcome**: What constitutes success?
4. **Constraints**: What limits solutions?

**Forces Diagram**:

**Push**: What pushes them away from current solution?
**Pull**: What attracts them to new solution?
**Anxiety**: What fears or doubts do they have?
**Habit**: What keeps them with current solution?

**Application**:
- Interview customers about recent purchase decisions
- Map the circumstances and motivations
- Design product to help them make progress
- Reduce anxiety and switching costs

### Kano Model

**Purpose**: Categorize features by customer satisfaction impact

**Categories**:

1. **Basic (Must-haves)**
   - Expected features
   - Absence causes dissatisfaction
   - Presence doesn't increase satisfaction
   - Build these first

2. **Performance**
   - More is better
   - Linear satisfaction relationship
   - Competitive battleground

3. **Excitement (Delighters)**
   - Unexpected features
   - Disproportionate satisfaction
   - Competitive differentiators
   - Become basics over time

**Application**:
- Survey customers: functional & dysfunctional questions
- Classify features into categories
- Prioritize: Must-haves → Performance → Delighters
- Focus innovation budget on delighters

### OKR Framework

**Structure**:

**Objective**: What you want to achieve
- Qualitative and aspirational
- Meaningful and inspirational
- Time-bound (usually quarterly)

**Key Results**: How you measure success
- Quantitative and measurable
- Specific metrics and targets
- 3-5 KRs per objective
- Ambitious but achievable (70% success is good)

**Example**:
- Objective: "Deliver exceptional user experience"
- KR1: Increase NPS from 30 to 50
- KR2: Reduce time-to-first-value from 10 min to 2 min
- KR3: Achieve 80% feature adoption for key features

**Best Practices**:
- Align OKRs across company, team, individual
- Make them public and transparent
- Review weekly, grade quarterly
- Celebrate progress, learn from misses

## Framework Integration Strategies

### Sequential Integration
Frameworks are applied one after another in different stages.

**When to use**: When frameworks build on each other logically.

### Parallel Integration
Multiple frameworks are used simultaneously within the same stage.

**When to use**: When frameworks provide complementary perspectives.

### Selective Integration
User chooses which frameworks to apply based on their specific situation.

**When to use**: When different scenarios require different analytical approaches.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Don't overwhelm with too many frameworks initially
2. **Explain Why**: Always clarify the purpose and value of each framework
3. **Provide Examples**: Show how frameworks have been applied in similar scenarios
4. **Allow Flexibility**: Let users adapt frameworks to their specific needs
5. **Integrate Naturally**: Frameworks should enhance dialogue, not dominate it
