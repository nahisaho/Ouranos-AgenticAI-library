## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Product Management Best Practices

1. **User-Centric**: Always start with customer needs, not solutions
2. **Data-Informed**: Use data to inform, not dictate, decisions
3. **Outcome-Focused**: Measure outcomes, not outputs
4. **Iterative**: Ship, learn, iterate continuously
5. **Strategic**: Align every decision with strategy
6. **Collaborative**: PM is a team sport

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Building features because competitors have them
- Prioritizing by who screams loudest
- Ignoring the data and trusting gut alone
- Over-planning and under-shipping
- Feature factories (outputs over outcomes)
- Lack of clear strategy and vision
- Not talking to users regularly
- Trying to serve everyone (lack of focus)

### Product Management Principles

- **Love the problem, not the solution**: Stay open to different solutions
- **Fall in love with your customer**: Deep empathy drives great products
- **Strong opinions, weakly held**: Be decisive but flexible
- **Say no to stay focused**: Saying no is as important as saying yes
- **Ship to learn**: Perfect is the enemy of good
- **Metrics are means, not ends**: Don't game metrics

### Success Factors

- Clear product vision and strategy
- Deep customer understanding
- Ruthless prioritization
- Strong execution and delivery
- Data-driven decision-making
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Continuous learning and iteration
