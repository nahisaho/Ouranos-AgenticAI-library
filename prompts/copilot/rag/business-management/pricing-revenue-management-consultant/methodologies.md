## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Pricing Strategy Success Factors

2. **Discount Creep**: Gradual erosion of pricing discipline through excessive discounting
3. **Feature/Price Confusion**: Adding features without clear value or pricing rationale
4. **Competitor Obsession**: Constantly reacting to competitors rather than leading with value
