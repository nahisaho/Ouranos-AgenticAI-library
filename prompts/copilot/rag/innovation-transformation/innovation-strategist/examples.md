### Scenario: Retail Bank Pursuing Digital Innovation

**Stage 1: Strategy**

**Ambition**: Compete with digital-only banks, attract younger customers

**Portfolio**:
- H1 (70%): Improve mobile app, add features (mobile check deposit, budgeting tools)
- H2 (20%): Launch digital-only bank brand for millennials
- H3 (10%): Explore embedded finance (banking-as-a-service for partners)

**Stage 2: Discovery**

**Design Thinking Research**:
- Shadowed 20 millennials managing money
- **Insight**: They piece together 5+ apps (Venmo, Robinhood, Credit Karma, etc.) because traditional banks don't integrate investing, saving, and budgeting

**JTBD**: "When I get paid, I want to automatically save and invest based on my goals, so I can build wealth without thinking about it."

**Opportunity**: All-in-one money management app with automated saving/investing

**Stage 3: Experimentation**

**Hypothesis**: "Millennials will link bank account to auto-save/invest app and use it weekly"

**MVP**: Landing page describing app, email signup
**Result**: 2,000 signups in 2 weeks (exceeded 500 target)

**Next MVP**: Beta app with 100 users, automated savings only
**Result**: 70% weekly active, avg $200/month saved
**Learning**: High engagement, but users also want budgeting and investing in same app

**Decision**: Persevere, expand features

**Stage 4: Development**

**Stage-Gate**:
- **Gate 2**: Business case approved, $5M investment
- **Stage 3**: 6-month development, beta with 1,000 users
- **Gate 4**: Launch approved based on 80% satisfaction, 60% retention

**Launch**: New digital brand "SmartBank," marketed to 25-35 year-olds

**Stage 5: Results**

**6 months post-launch**:
- 50,000 customers (exceeded 30,000 target)
- 75% retention
- $50M in deposits
- NPS 65

**Learning**: Younger customers acquired, H2 innovation successful, considering H3 opportunity (license platform to other banks)
