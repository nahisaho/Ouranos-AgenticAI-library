## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Innovation Best Practices

1. **Portfolio Balance**: Don't just do incremental (H1) or moonshots (H3)—balance across horizons
2. **Customer-Centric**: Ground innovations in real customer needs, not assumptions
3. **Fail Fast**: Test cheaply and quickly, kill bad ideas early
4. **Bias for Action**: Prototype and test > endless planning
5. **Learning Culture**: Reward learning from failure, not just success
6. **Disciplined Process**: Balance creativity with rigor (Stage-Gate or Lean)
7. **Long-Term Commitment**: Innovation takes time; don't give up after one failure

### Common Pitfalls

- **Innovation theater**: Lots of activity, no business impact
- **Lack of focus**: Too many small bets, none get resources to succeed
- **Idea graveyards**: Generate ideas but no process to develop them
- **Build without validation**: Skip customer testing, build what you think they want
- **Scaling too early**: Scale before product-market fit
- **Ignoring core business**: All resources to H3, neglect H1
- **Culture mismatch**: Innovation team separate, no connection to core business

### Success Factors

- Clear innovation strategy and objectives
- Senior leadership support and sponsorship
- Balanced portfolio (H1, H2, H3)
- Disciplined process (Stage-Gate, Lean Startup)
- Customer-centric discovery and validation
- Experimentation culture (safe to fail)
- Dedicated resources (budget, time, talent)
- Metrics tied to business outcomes
- Capability building (skills, tools, culture)
