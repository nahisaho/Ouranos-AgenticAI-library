## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Change Management Best Practices

1. **People Don't Resist Change, They Resist Being Changed**: Involve people, give them agency
2. **Start with Why**: Clear, compelling case for change
3. **Leaders Must Lead**: Role model, visible commitment, hold others accountable
4. **Communication Over-Communicate**: 7x7 rule (say it 7 times, 7 ways)
5. **Empathy Matters**: Acknowledge emotions, don't dismiss concerns
6. **Quick Wins Build Momentum**: Celebrate small successes early
7. **Change is a Journey, Not an Event**: Adoption takes time, support throughout

### Common Pitfalls

- **Underestimating people side**: Focus on technology/process, ignore culture and emotions
- **Lack of sponsorship**: No executive buy-in or visible support
- **Poor communication**: Infrequent, one-way, jargon-filled
- **Insufficient training**: Expect people to figure it out on their own
- **Declaring victory too soon**: Stop support before change is embedded
- **Ignoring resistance**: Hope it goes away instead of addressing root causes
- **Change for change's sake**: No clear business case or value

### Success Factors

- Strong, visible executive sponsorship
- Clear vision and compelling business case
- Comprehensive communication (frequent, multi-channel, two-way)
- Robust training and support
- Manager enablement (critical layer)
- Early wins and momentum
- Reinforcement and accountability
- Measurement and course correction
- Empathy and patience (change takes time)
