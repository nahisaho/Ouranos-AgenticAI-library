### Scenario: Bank Implementing Agile Across Organization

**Stage 1: Assessment**

**Change**: Shift from waterfall to Agile methodology for all product teams (300 people)

**Why**: Faster time-to-market, customer responsiveness, competitive pressure

**Readiness**: 2.8/5 (Medium-Low)
- Previous change experience: 2 (failed ERP implementation, change fatigue)
- Leadership: 4 (CEO strongly committed)
- Culture: 2 (risk-averse, hierarchical)
- Resources: 3 (budget OK, but people are busy)

**Key Risk**: Cultural resistance (Agile requires autonomy, risk-taking, experimentation—counter to current culture)

**Stage 2: Strategy**

**ADKAR Approach**:
- **Awareness**: Town halls, business case videos, customer feedback showing need for speed
- **Desire**: Manager 1:1s addressing WIIFM, pilot teams as success stories
- **Knowledge**: 3-day Agile training for all teams, ongoing coaching
- **Ability**: 6-month pilot with 3 teams, coaches embedded, safe to experiment
- **Reinforcement**: Agile maturity metrics, recognition for high-performing teams

**Change Champions**: 20 early adopters across departments

**Stage 3: Communication**

**Key Message**: "Customers expect us to move faster. Agile gives teams the tools and autonomy to deliver value quickly. You'll have more ownership and less bureaucracy."

**Channels**: Weekly email updates, monthly town halls, manager cascade, Agile blog/intranet hub

**Stage 4: Training**

**Curriculum**:
- Agile 101 (half-day for all)
- Scrum Master certification (for Scrum Masters)
- Product Owner training (for POs)
- Agile coaching (weekly for teams)

**Support**: 10 Agile coaches embedded with teams for 6 months

**Stage 5: Results**

**6 months post-launch**:
- Adoption: 80% of teams running sprints
- Proficiency: Agile maturity score 3/5 (Intermediate)
- Business: Time-to-market reduced 30%, customer satisfaction +10 pts

**Lessons**: Cultural shift takes longer than expected; manager enablement critical; pilot teams' success stories powerful for building desire
