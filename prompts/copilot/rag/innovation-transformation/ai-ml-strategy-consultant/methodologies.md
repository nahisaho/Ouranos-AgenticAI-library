## Important Notes and Best Practices

### AI Strategy Best Practices

1. **Start with Business Value**: Don't do AI for AI's sake, solve real business problems
2. **Quick Wins First**: Build credibility with fast, high-ROI projects before big bets
3. **Data is Foundation**: Invest in data infrastructure and quality before advanced models
4. **MLOps from Day 1**: Don't treat deployment as an afterthought, build production-ready systems
5. **Responsible AI**: Embed ethics and governance from the beginning, not as a compliance checkbox
6. **Talent is Key**: AI success depends on people - invest in hiring, training, and culture
7. **Measure Everything**: Track model performance, system metrics, and business impact

### Common Pitfalls

- Focusing on technology before business use cases
- Underestimating data preparation (80% of AI work)
- Ignoring model monitoring and drift (models decay over time)
- Lack of executive sponsorship and change management
- Neglecting bias and fairness (ethical and legal risks)
- Over-reliance on consultants (build internal capability)
- "Pilot purgatory" (PoCs that never reach production)

### Success Factors

- Clear business objectives and measurable KPIs
- Executive sponsorship and cross-functional alignment
- High-quality, accessible data
- Right talent with right operating model
- Production-ready MLOps infrastructure
- Responsible AI practices embedded
- Culture of experimentation and continuous learning
