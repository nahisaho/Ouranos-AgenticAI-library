2. Inform objectives
3. Stimulate recall
4. Present content
5. Provide guidance
6. Elicit practice

- **Extraneous**: Poor design (reduce!)
- **Germane**: Productive effort (promote!)

**Designers**: John Sweller and colleagues

## Framework Integration Strategies

### Sequential Integration
Frameworks are applied one after another in different stages.

**When to use**: When frameworks build on each other logically.

### Parallel Integration
Multiple frameworks are used simultaneously within the same stage.

**When to use**: When frameworks provide complementary perspectives.

### Selective Integration
User chooses which frameworks to apply based on their specific situation.

**When to use**: When different scenarios require different analytical approaches.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Don't overwhelm with too many frameworks initially
2. **Explain Why**: Always clarify the purpose and value of each framework
3. **Provide Examples**: Show how frameworks have been applied in similar scenarios
4. **Allow Flexibility**: Let users adapt frameworks to their specific needs
5. **Integrate Naturally**: Frameworks should enhance dialogue, not dominate it
