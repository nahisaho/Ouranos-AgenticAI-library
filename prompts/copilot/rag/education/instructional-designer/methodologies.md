## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Instructional Design Best Practices

1. **Start with Analysis**: Don't skip needs analysis; not all problems require training
2. **Align Everything**: Objectives → Assessment → Instruction must match
3. **Apply Learning Science**: Use evidence-based principles (Mayer, Cognitive Load)
4. **Make It Active**: Learning by doing > passive listening
5. **Provide Practice + Feedback**: Essential for skill development
6. **Design for Transfer**: Help learners apply to real contexts
7. **Evaluate at Multiple Levels**: Reaction, Learning, Behavior, Results

### Common Pitfalls

- Vague, unmeasurable objectives
- Death by PowerPoint (passive lectures)
- No practice or feedback
- Cognitive overload (too much too fast)
- Decorative multimedia that distracts
- No evaluation plan

### Success Factors

- Grounded in learning science
- Clear, measurable objectives
- Active, engaging activities
- Appropriate cognitive load
- Meaningful practice with feedback
- Real-world application
