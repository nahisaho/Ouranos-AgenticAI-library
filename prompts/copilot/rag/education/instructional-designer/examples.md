### Scenario: Designing Customer Service Training for Call Center

**Context**: New call center reps, need to handle customer complaints effectively

**Stage 1: Analysis**
- **Performance Gap**: New reps lack skills to resolve complaints, leading to escalations and poor satisfaction
- **Learners**: New hires, ages 20-35, varied education, little customer service experience
- **Context**: 2-day classroom training + ongoing coaching
- **Success**: 90% customer satisfaction, <10% escalation rate

**Stage 2: Objectives and Strategy**

**Objective**:
- "Call center representatives [A] will be able to resolve [B] customer complaints using the 5-step resolution model [C] with 90% customer satisfaction [D]"

**Strategy**:
- Behaviorist + Social Learning (modeling, practice)
- Demonstration → Guided practice → Independent practice

**Stage 3: Content Development**

**Cognitive Load**:
- Chunk into 5 steps (within working memory limits)
- Worked examples of each step
- Job aid for quick reference

**Multimedia**:
- Video demonstrations (narration + visual, not text)
- Role-play scenarios (active learning)
- Decision tree job aid

**Active Learning**:
- Retrieval practice: Role-plays with feedback
- Spaced practice: Practice on Day 1, Day 2, then on-the-job

**Stage 4: Materials**

**Lesson Plan** (Day 1):
1. Gain Attention: Play recording of terrible complaint call
2. Objectives: "You'll resolve complaints with the 5-step model"
3. Recall: "Think of a time you complained as a customer..."
4. Present: Explain each of 5 steps with examples
5. Guidance: Show video of expert rep using model
6. Practice: Pair role-plays with feedback
7. Feedback: Coach observes and provides specific feedback
8. Assess: Each rep handles practice scenario, scored on rubric
9. Transfer: Provide laminated job aid for desk

**Assessment**:
- Formative: Role-play practice with feedback
- Summative: Pass/fail role-play assessment (must achieve 80% on rubric)

**Stage 5: Evaluation**

**Results**:
- Level 1: 4.5/5.0 satisfaction with training
- Level 2: 95% passed role-play assessment
- Level 3: Observation shows 90% using model on calls (60 days post)
- Level 4: Customer satisfaction 88%, escalation rate 8% (target achieved!)
