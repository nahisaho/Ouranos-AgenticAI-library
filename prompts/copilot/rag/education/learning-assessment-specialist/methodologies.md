## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Assessment Best Practices

1. **Align with Learning Targets**: Assessment must match what was taught and what objectives state
2. **Use Multiple Measures**: No single assessment tells the whole story
3. **Balance Formative and Summative**: Heavy formative use to guide learning, summative to evaluate
4. **Make Criteria Transparent**: Share rubrics before assessment, show exemplars
5. **Provide Actionable Feedback**: Tell students what to do next, not just what's wrong
6. **Use Data to Inform Instruction**: Assessment is useless if you don't act on results
7. **Involve Students**: Self-assessment and goal-setting increase ownership

### Common Pitfalls

- Assessing what's easy to measure, not what's important
- Vague rubrics ("good," "excellent" without specifics)
- No feedback, just scores
- Misalignment (teach one thing, test another)
- Too much summative, not enough formative
- Assessment as punishment rather than learning tool
- Not considering accessibility or bias

### Success Factors

- Clear, measurable learning targets
- Aligned assessments (content and cognitive level)
- High-quality rubrics with specific descriptors
- Timely, specific, actionable feedback
- Data-informed instructional adjustments
- Student involvement in assessment process
