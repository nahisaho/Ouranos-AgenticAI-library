### Scenario: 10th Grade Science - Ecosystem Unit Assessment

**Context**: End-of-unit summative assessment, measures understanding of ecosystems and food webs

**Stage 1: Purpose and Context**
- **Purpose**: Summative (evaluate mastery)
- **Learning Target**: "Analyze how energy flows through ecosystems and predict effects of changes"
- **Level**: 10th grade, mixed abilities
- **Time**: 90 minutes

**Stage 2: Method Selection**
- **Selected-Response** (40%): Multiple choice for vocabulary and basic concepts
- **Short Answer** (20%): Explain energy pyramid
- **Performance Task** (40%): Analyze real ecosystem disruption case study

**Stage 3: Item Writing**

**Multiple Choice Example**:
```
Which statement best explains why energy decreases at each trophic level?

A. Organisms at higher levels are more efficient
B. Energy is lost as heat through metabolic processes
C. Producers create less energy than consumers
D. Sunlight is not available at higher levels

Answer: B
```

**Performance Task**:

# Case Study: Wolf Reintroduction in Yellowstone

**Scenario**: You are a wildlife biologist advising the National Park Service.

In 1995, wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone after 70 years of absence. 
Your task is to analyze the ecological effects using the data provided.

**Data Provided**:
- Elk population graphs (1990-2010)
- Vegetation coverage (willow, aspen) over time
- Beaver population data
- River erosion measurements

**Your Task**:
1. Create a food web showing relationships between wolves, elk, vegetation, 
   beavers, and rivers
2. Analyze how wolf reintroduction affected each component (use data as evidence)
3. Predict what might happen if wolves were removed again

**Deliverable**: 2-3 page report with diagrams and data analysis
```

**Stage 4: Rubric**

| Criteria | Advanced (4) | Proficient (3) | Basic (2) | Below Basic (1) |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Food Web Accuracy** | All relationships correct; includes energy flow | Relationships mostly correct | Some relationships missing or incorrect | Many errors or incomplete |
| **Data Analysis** | Cites multiple data points; analyzes trends; draws logical conclusions | Uses data to support analysis | Limited use of data | Little to no data used |
| **Prediction** | Well-reasoned prediction based on evidence and ecological principles | Reasonable prediction with some evidence | Prediction made but little support | No prediction or illogical |
| **Scientific Communication** | Clear, organized, uses scientific terminology correctly | Mostly clear and organized | Somewhat unclear or disorganized | Unclear or hard to follow |

**Stage 5: Feedback and Data Use**

**Feedback to Students**:
```
Strengths:
- Your food web correctly shows the predator-prey relationship between 
  wolves and elk, and you included the trophic cascade to vegetation.

Areas for Growth:
- You mentioned that elk populations decreased, but you didn't cite 
  specific data (e.g., "Elk declined from 19,000 to 10,000 between 
  1995-2005"). Add quantitative evidence.

Next Steps:
- Revise your analysis section to include at least 3 specific data points
- Strengthen your prediction by explaining HOW wolves affect rivers 
  (through the chain: wolves → elk → vegetation → erosion)
```

**Data Analysis**:
- 78% proficient or above on food web construction
- Only 52% proficient on data analysis (need to re-teach how to cite evidence)
- 85% proficient on prediction
- **Instructional Response**: Mini-lesson on using quantitative data in scientific arguments

**Results**:
- Students improved scientific reasoning skills
- Data use gap identified and addressed
- Authentic task increased engagement
