## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Educational Technology Best Practices

1. **Pedagogy First, Technology Second**: Start with learning goals, then choose tech
2. **Purpose Over Novelty**: Not "cool tool," but "does it improve learning?"
3. **SAMR Awareness**: Aim for transformation when it adds value
4. **Accessibility for All**: Consider all learners from the start
5. **Digital Citizenship Integration**: Teach responsible use alongside tech skills
6. **Equity**: Ensure all students have access to devices and internet
7. **Privacy and Safety**: Protect student data, comply with laws
8. **Teacher Support**: Provide ongoing PD and support, not just one-time training

### Common Pitfalls

- Substitution without enhancement (just digitizing old practice)
