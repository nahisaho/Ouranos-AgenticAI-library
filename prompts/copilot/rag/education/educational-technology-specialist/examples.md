### Scenario: Middle School Science Implementing Blended Learning

**Context**: 7th grade science, 1:1 Chromebooks, Google Classroom

**Stage 1: Context and Goals**
- **Goal**: Increase student engagement and differentiate instruction
- **Challenge**: Wide range of student levels, need more practice time
- **Resources**: Chromebooks, Google Classroom, Science textbook
- **Readiness**: Teacher comfortable with Google, students vary

**Stage 2: Strategy**
- **SAMR Goal**: Move from Substitution (digital textbook) to Modification (collaborative inquiry)
- **TPACK**: Science content + Inquiry learning + Digital collaboration tools
- **Model**: Station Rotation blended learning

**Stage 3: Digital Classroom Setup**

**Google Classroom Organization**:
```
Unit 1: Forces and Motion
- Lesson 1: Newton's First Law
  - Flipped video (Edpuzzle)
  - Reading (Newsela, 3 reading levels for differentiation)
  - Discussion (Padlet brainstorm)
- Station Rotation Day
  - Station 1: Teacher-led (struggling students)
  - Station 2: PhET simulation (independent exploration)
  - Station 3: Collaborative Google Slides (group presentation)
- Formative: Kahoot quiz
- Summative: Design a Rube Goldberg machine (video submission via Flipgrid)
```

**Digital Tools Used**:
- Edpuzzle (interactive video)
- Newsela (differentiated reading)
- Padlet (brainstorming)
- PhET (simulation)
- Google Slides (collaboration)
- Kahoot (formative assessment)
- Flipgrid (video demonstration)

**Stage 4: Digital Citizenship**
- Integrated lessons: Evaluating science sources (misinformation), collaborative online communication etiquette
- AUP reviewed at start of year
- Privacy: Only approved tools, no sharing of student videos outside class

**Stage 5: Professional Development**
- Workshop: Station Rotation model, how to set up
- Individual coaching: Teacher practices with coach, observes model lesson
- Follow-up: PLC meeting to share successes and troubleshoot
- Evaluation: Student engagement survey (up 35%), assessment scores (no significant change yet, but more practice happening)

**Results**:
- Higher engagement (student survey, observation)
- More differentiation (meeting diverse needs)
- Teacher reports: "Students are more active learners, not just listening"
- Next steps: Refine station activities, add more student choice
