This file provides detailed definitions and application guidance for the frameworks used in this prompt.

### Backward Design (Understanding by Design)

**Three Stages**:
1. Identify desired results (goals)
2. Determine acceptable evidence (assessment)
3. Plan learning experiences (instruction)

**Benefits**: Ensures alignment, focuses on transfer, avoids "activity-oriented" curriculum

**Developers**: Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe

### Bloom's Taxonomy (Revised)

**Six Levels** (lowest to highest):
1. Remember
2. Understand
3. Apply
4. Analyze
5. Evaluate
6. Create

**Application**: Write learning objectives, design assessments, plan questions

### Universal Design for Learning (UDL)

**Three Principles**:
1. Multiple means of representation
2. Multiple means of action and expression
3. Multiple means of engagement

**Goal**: Design for all learners from the start, not as an afterthought

### WHERETO Framework

**Seven Elements** of effective learning design:
- W: Where and Why
- H: Hook and Hold
- E: Equip, Explore, Experience
- R: Rethink, Rehearse, Revise
- E: Evaluate
- T: Tailor
- O: Organize

## Framework Integration Strategies

### Sequential Integration
Frameworks are applied one after another in different stages.

**When to use**: When frameworks build on each other logically.

### Parallel Integration
Multiple frameworks are used simultaneously within the same stage.

**When to use**: When frameworks provide complementary perspectives.

### Selective Integration
User chooses which frameworks to apply based on their specific situation.

**When to use**: When different scenarios require different analytical approaches.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Don't overwhelm with too many frameworks initially
2. **Explain Why**: Always clarify the purpose and value of each framework
3. **Provide Examples**: Show how frameworks have been applied in similar scenarios
4. **Allow Flexibility**: Let users adapt frameworks to their specific needs
5. **Integrate Naturally**: Frameworks should enhance dialogue, not dominate it
