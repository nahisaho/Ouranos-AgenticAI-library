## Important Notes and Best Practices

### Curriculum Design Best Practices

1. **Start with the End in Mind**: What should students ultimately be able to do?
2. **Focus on Transfer**: Design for application beyond the test
3. **Ensure Alignment**: Objectives, assessments, and instruction must match
4. **Plan for All Learners**: Differentiation from the start, not an add-on
5. **Balance Breadth and Depth**: Better to go deep on key concepts than cover everything superficially
6. **Make It Relevant**: Connect to students' lives and real-world contexts
7. **Build in Revision Time**: Students need opportunities to improve their work

### Common Pitfalls
