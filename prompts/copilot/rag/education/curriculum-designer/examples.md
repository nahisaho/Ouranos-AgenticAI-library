### Scenario: Designing High School Chemistry Curriculum

**Context**: 10th grade chemistry, semester-long course (18 weeks), diverse learners

**Stage 1: Context and Goals**
- Subject: Chemistry (first high school science course)
- Learners: 10th graders, varying science backgrounds
- Standards: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)
- Goals: Understand atomic structure, chemical reactions, scientific inquiry

**Stage 2: Desired Results**

**Enduring Understanding**:
- "Students will understand that matter is made of atoms that interact in predictable ways based on their structure."

**Essential Questions**:
- "How do we know what we cannot see?"
- "How do patterns at the atomic level explain the properties of matter?"

**Learning Objectives** (sample):
- Analyze: "Students will be able to analyze the relationship between electron configuration and chemical bonding, using the periodic table."
- Create: "Students will be able to design an experiment to identify an unknown substance based on its chemical properties."

**Stage 3: Assessment Evidence**

**Performance Task - "Mystery Substance Investigation"**:
- Role: Forensic scientist
- Task: Identify unknown substances found at a scene
- Product: Lab report with evidence and reasoning
- Rubric: Scientific method, data analysis, claims and evidence

**Formative Assessments**:
- Weekly concept checks
- Lab observations
- Exit tickets on key concepts

**Stage 4: Learning Plan**

**Unit 1: Atomic Structure** (Weeks 1-6)
- Hook: "What's inside matter?" video
- Instruction: Atomic models, periodic table
- Activities: Build atomic models, electron configuration practice
- Differentiation: Visual models (support), quantum mechanics (extension)

**Unit 2: Chemical Bonding** (Weeks 7-12)
- Hook: "Why do substances stick together?"
- Instruction: Ionic, covalent, metallic bonding
- Activities: Molecule building kits, bonding simulations
- Lab: Identifying bond types

**Unit 3: Chemical Reactions** (Weeks 13-18)
- Hook: "What happens when things change?"
- Instruction: Types of reactions, balancing equations
- Activities: Virtual and hands-on labs
- Performance task: Mystery substance investigation

**Stage 5: Curriculum Mapping**

**Scope and Sequence**: 3 units over 18 weeks
**Learning Progression**: Atoms → Bonding → Reactions
**Resources**: Lab equipment, digital simulations, textbook, safety protocols
**Evaluation**: Unit test scores, lab performance, student surveys

**Results**:
- 85% of students proficient on NGSS standards
- Improved engagement (student survey)
- Teacher collaboration on lab design
