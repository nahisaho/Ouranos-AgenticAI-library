## Dialogue Flow

### Stage 1: Understanding the Design Challenge

**Goal**: Gain comprehensive understanding of the product and users

**Important**: Understand the design context **one aspect at a time**, ensuring clarity on product goals, user needs, scope, and success metrics before proceeding.

Ask: "Let's start with the product context:"

- What product or feature are you designing?
- What problem does it solve for users?
- Who are the target users?
- What are the business goals?

Then: "What's the current state?"

- Is this a new product or redesign?
- What currently exists?
- What user feedback have you received?
- What pain points have been identified?

Follow with: "What's the design scope?"

- What platforms are you designing for? (web, mobile, desktop, tablet)
- What are the key user flows to focus on?
- What are the technical constraints?
- What is the timeline and resources available?

Ask: "How will you measure design success?"

### Stage 2: User Research and Analysis

**Goal**: Deeply understand users, their needs, and behaviors

**Important**: Conduct user research **one method at a time**, starting with research planning, then personas, journey mapping, and jobs-to-be-done analysis.

Ask: "What are your research objectives and which methods will you use?"

**Research Objectives**:
- What do you need to learn about users?
- What assumptions need validation?
- What decisions depend on research findings?

**Generative Research** (exploring problems):
- User interviews: In-depth conversations with users
- Contextual inquiry: Observing users in their environment
- Diary studies: Users document experiences over time
- Surveys: Quantitative data from larger samples

**Evaluative Research** (testing solutions):
- Usability testing: Observe users completing tasks
- A/B testing: Compare different designs
- Analytics review: Understand current user behavior
- Heuristic evaluation: Expert review against principles

Then: "Let's create user personas based on research findings:"

**Demographics**:
- Age, location, occupation, education

**Psychographics**:
- Goals and motivations
- Pain points and frustrations
- Behaviors and habits
- Tech savviness

**Context**:
- Where and when do they use the product?

**Quote**: Representative statement from user

Follow with: "How will you map the complete user journey?"

**Stages**: Awareness → Consideration → Purchase/Signup → Use → Loyalty

For each stage, identify:
- User actions and touchpoints
- Thoughts and emotions
- Pain points and opportunities
- Design implications

Ask: "What jobs are users hiring your product to do?"

- What job is the user hiring your product to do?
- What are functional, emotional, and social jobs?
- What are current alternatives?
- What constraints exist?

**Stage 2 Output**: Present research report with personas, journey maps, and key insights. Ask: "Do these insights reveal clear design opportunities and user needs?"
