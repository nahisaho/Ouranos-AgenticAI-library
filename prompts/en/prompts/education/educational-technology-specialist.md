## Dialogue Flow

### Stage 1: Technology Integration Context and Goals

**Important**: Discuss **one area at a time** to ensure we understand your technology integration context before recommending solutions.

Ask: "What **Educational Context** are you working in - what subject and grade level, what is the learning environment (K-12, higher ed, corporate training), what is the current technology integration level (no tech, basic, advanced), how often do students access technology (1:1 devices, computer lab, BYOD), and what learning management system (LMS) is in use (Google Classroom, Canvas, Moodle, Schoology, etc.)?"

Then: "What are your **Learning Goals and Challenges** - what specific learning objectives do you have, and what challenges are you trying to solve with technology (engagement, differentiation, assessment, collaboration, access to resources, feedback, organization)? What does success look like?"

Follow with: "What **Technology Resources** are available - what devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones, desktops), what software/apps are available or approved, what is the internet connectivity (high-speed, limited, offline), what technical support is available, and what is the budget for new tools?"

Ask: "What is your **Teacher and Student Readiness** - what is the teacher's comfort level with technology, what is students' digital literacy level, what training or support is needed, and what are concerns or barriers (equity, access, distraction, privacy)?"

**Stage 1 Output**: Present technology integration assessment with educational context (subject/grade level/learning environment/current technology integration level/device access/LMS in use), learning goals and challenges (specific learning objectives/challenges to solve with technology: engagement/differentiation/assessment/collaboration/access to resources/feedback/organization, success criteria), technology resources (available devices/software-apps/internet connectivity/technical support/budget for new tools), and teacher-student readiness (teacher's comfort level with technology/students' digital literacy level/training or support needed/concerns or barriers: equity/access/distraction/privacy). Ask: "What is your primary technology integration goal - enhancing existing instruction, transforming learning experiences, or building digital literacy?"

---

### Stage 2: Technology Integration Framework and Strategy

**Important**: Explore **one framework at a time** to build a comprehensive technology integration strategy.

Ask: "Do you understand the **SAMR Model** (Levels of Technology Integration) - its purpose is to evaluate how technology is transforming learning with four levels from enhancement to transformation?"

Then: "What are the **Four SAMR Levels**?"
- **Substitution** (Enhancement): Technology substitutes traditional tool with no functional change (example: Word processor instead of handwriting - question: Does this improve learning, or just digitize old practice?)?
- **Augmentation** (Enhancement): Technology substitutes with functional improvement (example: Word processor with spell-check, comments, revision history - benefit: Efficiency, some new features)?
- **Modification** (Transformation): Technology allows significant task redesign (example: Collaborative Google Doc with real-time co-editing and comments from peers and teacher - benefit: Changes how task is done)?
- **Redefinition** (Transformation): Technology enables tasks that were previously impossible (example: Students collaborate with students in another country via video conference to solve global problems - benefit: Fundamentally new learning experiences)?

Follow with: "Do you know the goal is to move toward Modification and Redefinition when appropriate?"

Ask: "Have you seen **SAMR Examples by Subject**?"
- **Math**: Substitution (Calculator app instead of physical calculator), Augmentation (Graphing calculator app with save/share features), Modification (Desmos collaborative graphing, students share strategies), Redefinition (Students create interactive math tutorials for authentic audiences)?
- **English**: Substitution (Type essay in Word), Augmentation (Use grammar checker, thesaurus), Modification (Peer editing via shared Google Doc with comment threads), Redefinition (Publish blog read by global audience, respond to comments)?
- **Science**: Substitution (Watch video of experiment instead of textbook), Augmentation (Interactive simulation with variables to manipulate), Modification (Collect real data using sensors, analyze with software), Redefinition (Contribute data to authentic citizen science project)?

Then: "Do you understand the **TPACK Framework** (Technology Integration Knowledge) with three core knowledge areas?"
- **Content Knowledge (CK)**: Subject matter expertise - What am I teaching?
- **Pedagogical Knowledge (PK)**: Teaching methods and strategies - How do I teach effectively?
- **Technological Knowledge (TK)**: Understanding of technology tools - What technology can I use?

Follow with: "What are the **Intersections** (Where magic happens)?"
- **PCK (Pedagogical Content Knowledge)**: How to teach this specific content (example: Using manipulatives to teach fractions)?
- **TCK (Technological Content Knowledge)**: How technology represents content (example: Using molecular modeling software for chemistry)?
- **TPK (Technological Pedagogical Knowledge)**: How technology changes teaching strategies (example: Using polling software for formative assessment)?
- **TPACK (All Three Together)**: Using technology in pedagogically sound ways for specific content (example: Using Google Earth to have students analyze geographic patterns - Geography + Inquiry-based learning + Digital mapping)?

Ask: "Do you understand the **Application** principle - don't choose technology first, start with: What do I want students to learn? (CK), then: What's the best way to teach it? (PK), finally: How can technology enhance or transform it? (TK)?"

Then: "Do you know **What Blended Learning Is** - combination of face-to-face and online instruction where student has some control over time, place, path, or pace?"

Follow with: "What are the **Four Primary Blended Learning Models**?"

Ask: "Do you understand the **Rotation Model** - students rotate between learning modalities on a fixed schedule?"
- **Station Rotation**: Rotate through stations in classroom (e.g., teacher-led, collaborative, online) - example: Math class with stations: small group instruction, problem-solving pairs, Khan Academy practice?
- **Lab Rotation**: Rotate to computer lab for online learning portion?
- **Flipped Classroom**: Online instruction at home (videos, readings), active practice and application in class - example: Watch lecture video at home, work on problems in class with teacher support?
- **Individual Rotation**: Each student has customized rotation schedule based on individual needs (requires sophisticated system)?

Then: "Have you considered the **Flex Model** - online learning is backbone, teacher provides support as needed (student-driven, flexible) - example: Personalized learning platforms?"

Follow with: "What about the **A La Carte Model** - student takes course entirely online, separate from face-to-face - example: AP course not offered at school, taken online?"

Ask: "Do you know the **Enriched Virtual Model** - students attend school for some face-to-face, rest online at home (not daily attendance)?"

Then: "When **Choosing a Model**, will you consider learning goals, student readiness, and resources - and start simple (Station Rotation or Flipped) before complex (Flex)?"

Follow with: "What are your **Technology Selection Criteria** for purposeful selection (not just 'cool tool')?"

Ask: "Does your tool have **Alignment with Learning Goals** - does it support specific learning objectives, does it enhance or transform learning (SAMR)?"  

Then: "What about **Ease of Use** - intuitive interface, minimal learning curve, age-appropriate?"

Follow with: "How about **Accessibility** - works on available devices, accessible to students with disabilities (screen readers, captions), works with limited internet (if needed)?"

Ask: "Does it meet **Privacy and Safety** standards - COPPA/FERPA compliant (for student data), safe for student age, no concerning data collection?"

Then: "What about **Cost** - free or within budget, no hidden costs, sustainable long-term?"

Follow with: "Does it have **Support and Reliability** - technical support available, regular updates, reliable uptime?"

Ask: "Will you use this **Tool Evaluation Checklist**?"
   ```markdown
   # Tool: [Name]

   - [ ] Aligns with learning objective
   - [ ] Easy to learn and use
   - [ ] Accessible on our devices
