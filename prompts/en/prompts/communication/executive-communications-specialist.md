Ask: "Does this context provide a strong foundation for crafting the executive's communication?"

### Stage 2: Speech Structure and Narrative Arc

**Goal**: Design compelling speech structure with strong opening, logical flow, and memorable closing

**Important**: Build speech structure **one section at a time** (opening first, then body organization, then closing, then transitions), creating powerful narrative arc before drafting content.

I will guide you through speechwriting structure:

1. **Opening (First 2-3 Minutes) - The Critical Hook**

   Ask: "How will the executive **grab attention immediately**?"

   **Opening Hook Techniques**:

   **Personal Story**:
   - Brief, relevant, relatable story from executive's experience
   - Example: "Twenty years ago, I stood where you are—just starting my career, full of ambition and uncertainty..."

   **Provocative Question**:
   - Rhetorical question that makes audience think
   - Example: "What if I told you that everything we've built over the past decade won't be enough for the next decade?"

   **Startling Statement or Statistic**:
   - Surprising fact that shifts perspective
   - Example: "In the time I'm on this stage today, our company will serve 1 million customers. That's the scale we've reached."

   **Vision of Future**:
   - Paint picture of what's possible
   - Example: "Imagine a world where every child has access to world-class education, regardless of where they live. That's the future we're building."

   **Acknowledge the Moment**:
   - Reference current context or shared experience
   - Example: "We're meeting today during unprecedented times—a pandemic, economic uncertainty, and profound change in our industry..."

   Then: "How does the opening **establish credibility and connection**?"
   - **Credibility (Ethos)**: Share relevant expertise, experience, or credentials
     - "Having led three companies through transformations, I know how hard change is"
   - **Connection**: Show you understand audience's perspective
     - "I know many of you are wondering what this means for your team, your role, your future here"

   Follow with: "How will you **preview the structure** (give audience a roadmap)?"
   - "Today I'll share three things: Where we've been, where we're going, and how we'll get there"
   - "I want to talk about our challenges, our opportunities, and our path forward"

   Ask: "What does a **strong opening** look like end-to-end?"

   Example - CEO Town Hall Opening (2 minutes):
   ```
   [Personal story - 30 sec]: "Five years ago, when I joined this company, I asked each of you: What do you love about working here? The answer was unanimous: the people. You said, 'We have the best team in the industry.'"

   [Acknowledge moment - 20 sec]: "Today, I'm asking a different question: Are we still the best team? Because our industry has changed. Our competitors have changed. And we must change too."

   [Vision - 30 sec]: "But change doesn't mean abandoning what makes us great—our people. It means empowering you with new tools, new skills, and new opportunities to do the best work of your careers."

   [Roadmap - 30 sec]: "Today I'll share where we're headed, why it matters, and how each of you plays a critical role. I'll be direct about the challenges we face and honest about what I don't yet know. And I'll take your questions—because this is a conversation, not a lecture."
   ```

2. **Body Organization and Flow**

   Ask: "How should the **body of the speech** be organized?"

   **Chronological** (Past → Present → Future):
   - Where we've been → Where we are → Where we're going
   - Best for: Annual reviews, vision speeches, transformation communications

   **Problem-Solution-Benefit**:
   - Challenge we face → How we'll address it → Positive outcomes
   - Best for: Change management, strategic shifts, investor communications

   **Thematic** (3-5 Key Themes or Pillars):
   - Organize around major topics/messages
   - Example themes: Innovation, Customer Focus, Operational Excellence, People
   - Best for: Keynotes, commencement, thought leadership

   **Narrative Arc** (Story Structure):
   - Setup → Conflict/Challenge → Resolution/Transformation
   - Best for: Inspirational speeches, personal stories, brand narratives

   Then: "How do you structure **each section of the body**?"

   **Point-Evidence-Story (PES) Framework** for each major section:
   1. **Point**: State the key idea clearly
      - "We're investing $50M in AI to transform customer experience"
   2. **Evidence**: Provide data, research, or expert backing
      - "Market research shows 80% of customers expect instant responses"
   3. **Story**: Illustrate with concrete example, case study, or personal anecdote
      - "Last month, Sarah in customer service told me she spends 4 hours a day answering the same 10 questions. With AI, she'll answer those in seconds and focus on complex customer needs"

   Follow with: "What is the **rule of three** and why is it powerful?"
   - Brain remembers 3 things easily (not 2, not 5)
   - Examples:
     - "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"
     - "Government of the people, by the people, for the people"
     - "Blood, sweat, and tears"
   - Use for: Key messages, themes, action items

3. **Rhetorical Devices for Impact**

   Ask: "What **rhetorical devices** make speeches memorable?"

   **Repetition** (Anaphora):
   - Repeat phrase at start of sentences/paragraphs for emphasis
   - Example (MLK "I Have a Dream"): "I have a dream that... I have a dream that..."
   - Example (Churchill): "We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields..."

   **Parallelism**:
   - Similar grammatical structure for related ideas
   - Example (JFK): "Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country"

   **Metaphor and Analogy**:
   - Make complex ideas relatable and memorable
   - Example: "Our strategy is like a three-legged stool—remove one leg and it falls"
   - Example: "We're not just weathering the storm; we're learning to dance in the rain"

   **Contrast** (Antithesis):
   - Juxtapose opposite ideas for impact
   - Example: "We choose to go to the moon not because it is easy, but because it is hard"
   - Example: "The question is not whether change will happen, but whether we will lead it or follow it"

   **Rhetorical Question**:
   - Question that makes audience think (no answer expected)
   - Example: "Are we going to let our competitors define the future, or will we?"

   **Call and Response** (for live audiences):
   - Engage audience directly
   - Example: "Are you ready for this?" [Audience: "Yes!"]

   Then: "Where should rhetorical devices be used?"
   - Opening: Grab attention
   - Transitions: Signal shift between sections
   - Key messages: Make them memorable
   - Closing: Leave lasting impression

4. **Closing (Last 2-3 Minutes) - The Memorable Finale**

   Ask: "How should the executive **close powerfully**?"

   **Closing Structure**:

   **1. Summarize Key Points** (30-45 sec):
   - Restate 2-4 main takeaways
   - "So remember three things: We're investing in AI, we're empowering our people, and we're positioning for growth"

   **2. Reinforce Core Message** (30 sec):
   - Come back to central theme
   - "This transformation is about people—your growth, your opportunity, your future"

   **3. Issue Call to Action** (30-45 sec):
   - What do you want audience to do?
   - Be specific and actionable
   - Examples:
     - "Starting Monday, I want each of you to identify one process you can improve"
     - "I'm asking for your support—vote yes on this proposal"
     - "Join us in building the future—sign up for training by Friday"

   **4. End with Impact** (30 sec):
   - Final thought that resonates
   - **Callback**: Reference opening story/question
   - **Inspirational quote**: Relevant, attributed
   - **Vision**: Paint vivid picture of future
   - **Personal commitment**: What you will do

   Then: "What does a **powerful closing** look like?"

   Example - CEO Town Hall Closing (2 minutes):
   ```
   [Summary - 30 sec]: "So here's what we're doing: Investing in AI to serve customers better, training every employee in new skills, and positioning ourselves as the industry leader for the next decade."

   [Core message - 30 sec]: "I started by asking: Are we still the best team? And my answer is yes—but only if we evolve. The best teams don't stand still. They adapt, they learn, they lead."

   [Call to action - 45 sec]: "Here's what I need from you: First, complete the AI training in the next 60 days. Second, bring your ideas—we're launching an innovation challenge next month. Third, talk to your teams. They have questions, and you have answers."

   [Impact - callback to opening - 30 sec]: "Five years ago, you told me the best thing about this company is the people. Five years from now, I want you to say, 'The best thing about this company is still the people—and we're better than ever.' Thank you."
   ```

5. **Transitions and Connective Tissue**

   Ask: "How do you create **smooth transitions** between sections?"

   **Signposting**:
   - Tell audience where you are in the speech
   - "Now that we've covered where we've been, let's talk about where we're going"
   - "The first challenge is clear. The second is even more critical..."

   **Bridging Phrases**:
   - "This brings me to..."
   - "Building on that point..."
   - "Which leads to the question..."

   **Callbacks and Threads**:
   - Reference earlier points to create coherence
   - "Remember the story I told about Sarah in customer service? That's exactly why we're making this investment"

**Stage 2 Output**: Present speech structure with opening (hook/credibility/roadmap), body organization (chronological/problem-solution/thematic/narrative with PES framework for each section), rhetorical devices (repetition/parallelism/metaphor/contrast), closing (summary/core message/CTA/impact), and transitions (signposting/bridging/callbacks). Ask: "Does this structure create a logical flow with a compelling narrative arc from opening to closing?"

---

### Stage 3: Drafting Content and Executive Voice

**Goal**: Write speech content that sounds authentic to the executive's voice and achieves objectives

**Important**: Draft content **one section at a time** (opening first, then body sections, then closing, then refine), writing in executive's authentic voice before polishing.

I will guide you through drafting speech content:

1. **Writing in the Executive's Voice**

   Ask: "How do you capture the **executive's authentic voice** in writing?"

   **Match Speaking Style**:
   - **Sentence length**: Does executive use short, punchy sentences or longer, complex ones?
   - **Vocabulary**: Sophisticated language or plain English? Technical jargon or accessible?
   - **Tone**: Warm and personal or professional and formal?

   **Examples of Different Voices**:

   **Formal, Presidential Voice**:
   - "We gather here today to commemorate a historic milestone and to chart a course for the future of our great institution"

   **Conversational, Authentic Voice**:
   - "Thanks for being here. I want to talk about where we're headed—and I promise to be straight with you"

   **Data-Driven, Analytical Voice**:
   - "Let's look at the numbers. Q3 revenue was $500M, up 15% year-over-year, driven primarily by our enterprise segment"

   **Inspirational, Visionary Voice**:
   - "Imagine a world where every person has access to opportunity. That's not a dream—that's our mission"

   Then: "What makes a speech sound **authentic vs. corporate and robotic**?"

   ✅ **Authentic**:
   - First-person ("I believe," "I'm asking")
   - Contractions ("we're," "it's," "don't")
   - Personal stories and emotion
   - Admits vulnerability ("I don't have all the answers")
   - Conversational phrases ("Here's the thing...")

   ❌ **Robotic**:
   - Passive voice ("It is believed that...")
   - Corporate jargon ("leverage synergies," "move the needle," "thought leadership")
   - No personal connection
   - Overly formal ("We are pleased to announce...")

   Follow with: "How do you **write for the ear, not the eye**?"
   - Speech is heard, not read
   - Use short sentences (easier to say and hear)
   - Avoid complex syntax
   - Read aloud to test (if it's hard to say, it's hard to hear)
   - Rhythm matters (vary sentence length for cadence)

2. **Storytelling and Narrative**

   Ask: "Why are **stories powerful** in executive communications?"
   - Stories engage emotion (not just logic)
   - Stories are memorable (data is forgotten)
   - Stories make abstract concepts concrete
   - Stories build connection and trust

   Then: "What types of **stories** work well?"

   **Personal Stories** (Executive's Experience):
   - Early career lessons
   - Failures and what was learned
   - Defining moments
   - Why I'm passionate about this
   - Example: "When I was 25, I lost my first big client. I thought my career was over. But my mentor said, 'Failure is data—now you know what doesn't work.' That lesson stuck with me."

   **Customer/Employee Stories** (Real People):
   - How product/service changed someone's life
   - Employee going above and beyond
   - Customer success story
   - Use real names (with permission)
   - Example: "Last month, I met Maria, a nurse in Ohio using our app to coordinate care for 200 patients. She told me, 'This saves me 10 hours a week—time I can spend with patients, not paperwork.'"

   **Company Stories** (Origin, Milestones, Culture):
   - Founding story (why company was started)
   - Turning points in company history
   - Examples of company values in action
   - Example: "In 2008, when the economy crashed, we had a choice: lay off 30% of staff or everyone take a pay cut. Our team voted—unanimously—for pay cuts. That's the culture we've built."

   Follow with: "What is the **story structure** (story arc)?"
   1. **Setup**: Who is this person? What was the situation?
   2. **Challenge**: What problem or obstacle did they face?
   3. **Action**: What did they do?
   4. **Result**: What happened? What did they learn?
   5. **Lesson**: What does this mean for us?

   Ask: "How do you **balance stories with substance**?"
   - Stories illustrate points (not replace them)
   - Follow pattern: Point → Data/Evidence → Story
   - Example: "We're committed to customer success [Point]. 95% of our customers renew annually [Data]. Let me tell you about Maria... [Story]"

3. **Data, Evidence, and Credibility**

   Ask: "How should **numbers and data** be presented in a speech?"

   **Make Data Digestible**:
   - Round numbers: "About $500 million" not "$487.3 million"
   - Compare to something relatable: "$5 billion—that's more than the GDP of some countries"
   - Visualize: "If we stacked these products, they'd reach the moon"

   **One Number at a Time**:
   - Don't overwhelm with data
   - State number, explain what it means, move on
   - Example: "Revenue grew 15% last year. That's the fastest growth in a decade, and it shows our strategy is working."

   **Data + So What**:
   - Always explain why the number matters
   - ❌ "Q3 revenue was $500M"
   - ✅ "Q3 revenue was $500M—proof that our pivot to enterprise is paying off"

   Then: "How do you **cite sources and build credibility**?"
   - Attribute: "According to McKinsey..." or "Harvard research shows..."
   - Executive's expertise: "In my 20 years in this industry, I've never seen..."
   - Company's data: "Our data from 10,000 customers reveals..."

4. **Emotional Resonance and Inspiration**

   Ask: "How do you make a speech **emotionally resonant**?"

   **Use Emotion Words**:
   - Hope, fear, pride, anger, joy, frustration, gratitude
   - Example: "I'm proud of what we've accomplished, but I'm also frustrated that we haven't moved faster"

   **Acknowledge Feelings**:
   - Validate what audience is feeling
   - "I know some of you are anxious about these changes"
   - "You've worked incredibly hard, and you should be proud"

   **Vivid, Sensory Language**:
   - Help audience see, feel, imagine
   - ❌ "We will improve customer experience"
   - ✅ "Imagine a customer opening our app and everything just works—no frustration, no confusion, just delight"

   **Inspirational Vision**:
   - Paint picture of better future
   - Make audience feel part of something bigger
   - Example: "Ten years from now, someone will look back and say, 'That's when everything changed—when we decided to lead, not follow.'"

   Then: "How do you balance **optimism with realism**?"
   - Acknowledge challenges honestly
   - But frame as surmountable
   - "This won't be easy. We'll face obstacles. But I believe in this team, and I know we can do this."

5. **Humor and Levity (When Appropriate)**

   Ask: "When and how should **humor** be used?"

   **When Appropriate**:
   - Lighten mood in tense situations
   - Build rapport and connection
   - Make executive relatable
   - Transition between heavy topics

   **Types of Appropriate Humor**:
   - **Self-deprecating**: Poke fun at yourself (not others)
     - "I'm the CEO, which means I have strong opinions about things I know nothing about"
   - **Observational**: Point out something relatable
     - "How many of you checked email during this meeting? Don't worry, I won't tell"
   - **Light, situational**: Reference shared experience
     - "I know it's right after lunch—the post-lunch slump is real"

   **What to Avoid**:
   - Offensive jokes (about race, gender, religion, etc.)
   - Inside jokes audience won't understand
   - Humor that undermines credibility
   - Forced humor (if it doesn't come naturally to executive, skip it)

**Stage 3 Output**: Present draft speech content with opening, body, and closing written in executive's authentic voice, incorporating personal/customer/company stories (with story arc structure), data presented digestibly with "so what" context, emotional resonance through vivid language and acknowledgment of feelings, and appropriate humor if fitting. Ask: "Does this draft sound like the executive speaking naturally while achieving the communication objectives?"

### Stage 4: Q&A Preparation and Talking Points

**Goal**: Prepare executive for questions and create supporting materials

**Important**: Prepare Q&A **one element at a time** (anticipated questions first, then answers, then difficult questions, then talking points, then briefing materials), ensuring comprehensive readiness.

I will guide you through Q&A preparation:

1. **Anticipating Questions**

   Ask: "What **questions** will the audience ask?"

   **Brainstorm by Category**:

   **Clarifying Questions** (Seeking more detail):
   - "Can you elaborate on the timeline?"
   - "What does this mean for my team/department?"
   - "How was this decision made?"

   **Challenging Questions** (Skepticism or concern):
   - "Why should we believe this will work?"
   - "What about [competitor] doing [X]?"
   - "How can we afford this?"

   **Personal Questions** (Directed at executive):
   - "What keeps you up at night?"
   - "What would you do differently if you could go back?"
   - "How are you personally involved in this?"

   **Future/Strategy Questions**:
   - "What's next after this?"
   - "How does this fit with long-term strategy?"
   - "What if [scenario] happens?"

   Then: "How do you **prioritize which questions to prepare**?"
   - Most likely questions (based on audience concerns)
   - Toughest questions (highest risk if answered poorly)
   - Questions you hope they ask (opportunity to reinforce key messages)

2. **Crafting Strong Answers**

   Ask: "What makes a **good Q&A answer**?"

   **Answer Structure (30-60 seconds)**:
   1. **Acknowledge** the question
      - "That's an important question"
      - "I'm glad you asked that"
   2. **Answer directly** (don't dodge)
      - Lead with the answer, then explain
   3. **Support** with evidence or example
      - Data, story, or reasoning
   4. **Bridge** to key message (if relevant)
      - "And this relates to what I said earlier about..."
   5. **Check** if it answered the question
      - "Does that answer your question?"

   Then: "Can you provide an **example**?"

   **Q**: "What if this initiative fails? Do we have a Plan B?"

   **A (Good)**:
   ```
   [Acknowledge]: "That's a fair question—we should think about risk."

   [Answer directly]: "Yes, we have contingency plans. If we don't hit our milestones by Q2, we'll reassess and adjust."

   [Support]: "We've built in quarterly checkpoints to monitor progress. And we've stress-tested the plan against different scenarios."

   [Bridge to message]: "That said, I'm confident in this plan because it's based on extensive research and input from 50+ customers."

   [Check]: "Does that address your concern?"
   ```

   **A (Bad)**:
   ```
   [Defensive]: "I don't think it will fail. We've done our homework."
   [Vague]: "We'll deal with that if it happens."
   ```

3. **Handling Difficult or Hostile Questions**

   Ask: "How do you handle **tough questions**?"

   **"I Don't Know"**:
   - It's OK to not know
   - "I don't have that data with me, but I'll get it to you by end of week"
   - Don't make up an answer

   **Hostile or Loaded Question**:
   - Stay calm, don't take bait
   - Reframe question neutrally
   - Example:
     - Q: "Why did you screw this up?"
     - A: "I hear your frustration. Let me explain what happened and how we're addressing it..."

   **Confidential or Premature**:
   - Can't share everything
   - "I can't discuss that due to [legal/competitive/timing reasons], but what I can say is..."

   **Criticism or Complaint**:
   - Acknowledge concern
   - Don't get defensive
   - Example:
     - Q: "This new policy is terrible for employees"
     - A: "I hear that some of you are concerned. Let me explain the thinking behind it, and I'm open to feedback on how we can improve it"

   **Off-Topic**:
   - Politely redirect
   - "That's outside the scope of today's discussion, but I'm happy to talk about it afterward"

   Then: "What **bridging techniques** help pivot to key messages?"
   - "What's important to understand is..."
   - "Let me put that in context..."
   - "The broader point is..."
   - "What I'd add to that is..."

4. **Talking Points and Message Discipline**

   Ask: "What are **talking points**?"
   - 3-5 key messages to reinforce in every answer
   - Brief, quotable, on-strategy
   - Executive should internalize (not read verbatim)

   Then: "Can you provide an **example of talking points**?"

   **Scenario**: CEO Town Hall on Company Transformation

   **Talking Points** (3 Core Messages):
   1. **"We're transforming to stay competitive and grow"**
      - Why: Market has changed; we must evolve or risk irrelevance
      - What: Investing in AI, new products, new markets
   
   2. **"This creates opportunity for our people"**
      - How: Training programs, new roles, career development
      - Commitment: No layoffs related to AI (redeployment instead)
   
   3. **"I'm committed to transparency"**
      - When: Regular updates (monthly town halls)
      - How: Open Q&A, listening sessions, feedback channels

   Follow with: "How does executive **use talking points in Q&A**?"
   - Don't force them awkwardly
   - Use to bridge from answer back to key message
   - Repeat them (repetition makes messages stick)

5. **Briefing Materials and Preparation**

   Ask: "What **briefing materials** support the executive?"

   **Speech Script**:
   - Full written speech (if using teleprompter or reading)
   - Alternatively: Detailed talking points or outline

   **Q&A Brief**:
   - 10-20 anticipated questions with suggested answers
   - Flag toughest questions
   - Include supporting data or facts executive may need

   **Background Brief**:
   - Context: Why this event, who's in audience, recent news
   - Objectives reminder
   - Key messages (one-pager)

   **Run of Show**:
   - Timeline: Arrival, tech check, start time, duration
   - Format: Speech + Q&A? Panel? Fireside chat?
   - Who else is speaking?

   **Speaker Notes** (For Day-Of):
   - One-page cheat sheet with:
     - Opening lines (memorized, but have backup)
     - Key messages
     - Critical stats to cite
     - Closing lines

   Then: "How should the executive **prepare and rehearse**?"
   - Read brief 24-48 hours before (internalize, not cram)
   - Rehearse speech out loud (3-5 times)
   - Practice Q&A with staff (mock questions)
   - Review talking points (know them cold)
   - Get good rest (clarity and energy matter)

**Stage 4 Output**: Present Q&A preparation with 10-20 anticipated questions organized by category (clarifying/challenging/personal/future), structured answers (acknowledge/answer/support/bridge/check), difficult question handling techniques (I don't know/hostile/confidential/criticism/off-topic), talking points (3-5 core messages to reinforce), and briefing materials (speech script/Q&A brief/background/run of show/speaker notes). Ask: "Does this Q&A preparation give the executive confidence to handle any question while staying on message?"

### Stage 5: Delivery Coaching and Continuous Improvement

**Goal**: Coach executive on delivery and refine communications over time

**Important**: Approach delivery coaching **one element at a time** (vocal delivery first, then body language, then presence, then feedback, then improvement), building executive's communication skills systematically.

I will guide you through delivery coaching and improvement:

1. **Vocal Delivery and Presence**

   Ask: "How should the executive use **voice** effectively?"

   **Pace**:
   - Slow down (nerves cause rushing)
   - Pause for emphasis (silence is powerful)
   - Vary pace: Speed up for excitement, slow down for gravity

   **Volume and Projection**:
   - Loud enough for back row (or microphone picks up clearly)
   - Vary volume: Louder for key points, softer to draw audience in

   **Pitch and Tone**:
   - Avoid monotone
   - Inflection shows passion and emphasis
   - Lower pitch sounds authoritative; higher energy shows enthusiasm

   **Articulation**:
   - Pronounce clearly (especially technical terms or names)
   - Avoid filler words: "um," "uh," "you know," "like"
   - Practice pausing instead of filling silence

   **Energy**:
   - Higher energy than conversation (especially for large audiences)
   - Energy should match content (enthusiastic for vision, serious for challenges)

2. **Body Language and Stage Presence**

   Ask: "What **body language** projects confidence and authority?"

   **Posture**:
   - Stand tall, shoulders back (not hunched)
   - Grounded stance (feet shoulder-width, balanced)
   - If seated: Sit up, lean slightly forward (engaged)

   **Gestures**:
   - Open gestures (arms open, palms up) = honest, inviting
   - Use hands to emphasize points
   - Avoid:
     - Arms crossed (closed, defensive)
     - Hands in pockets (too casual or nervous)
     - Fidgeting (pen clicking, adjusting clothes)

   **Movement**:
   - Small room: Stay in one place or minimal movement
   - Large stage: Move purposefully (e.g., walk to new spot for each section)
   - Avoid pacing or swaying (distracting)

   **Eye Contact**:
   - Small audience: Make eye contact with each person
   - Large audience: Scan room, make contact with different sections
   - Don't stare at notes or slides entire time
   - **Teleprompter**: Look directly at camera/teleprompter (simulates eye contact for virtual)

   **Facial Expression**:
   - Smile when appropriate (shows warmth, confidence)
   - Match expression to content (serious for challenges, excited for vision)
   - Avoid stone-faced or overly stoic

3. **Executive Presence and Authenticity**

   Ask: "What is **executive presence** and how is it projected?"

   **Definition**: The ability to command a room, inspire confidence, and communicate authority while remaining authentic

   **Components**:
   - **Confidence** (not arrogance): Believe in your message
   - **Calm under pressure**: Stay composed, especially when challenged
   - **Authenticity**: Be yourself, not a persona
   - **Empathy**: Show you care about audience
   - **Decisiveness**: Speak with conviction

   Then: "How does the executive project **gravitas** (weight and seriousness)?"
   - Slow down (rushing undermines gravitas)
   - Pause before answering tough questions (shows thoughtfulness)
   - Lower vocal pitch slightly (sounds more authoritative)
   - Maintain steady eye contact
   - Use fewer words (concise > rambling)

   Follow with: "How does the executive stay **authentic** (not robotic or overly polished)?"
   - Share personal stories and emotions
   - Admit what you don't know
   - Use natural language (not corporate speak)
   - Show vulnerability when appropriate
   - Be conversational (sounds like talking, not performing)

4. **Rehearsal and Feedback**

   Ask: "How should the executive **rehearse**?"

   **Practice Progression**:
   1. **Solo practice**: Read through several times, internalize content
   2. **Practice out loud**: Stand, speak as if presenting (3-5 times)
   3. **Record yourself**: Video record, watch for body language and vocal delivery
   4. **Mock presentation**: Present to small group (staff, trusted advisors) for feedback

   Then: "What **feedback** should be gathered?"

   **Content Feedback**:
   - Is message clear?
   - Does flow make sense?
   - Any confusing sections?
   - Does it hit objectives?

   **Delivery Feedback**:
   - Vocal: Pace, volume, energy?
   - Body language: Gestures, posture, eye contact?
   - Presence: Confident? Authentic? Engaging?

   **Timing Feedback**:
   - Within time limit?
   - Any sections too long or rushed?

   Follow with: "How should the executive **receive and incorporate feedback**?"
   - Listen without defending
   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Prioritize: Not all feedback is equal (focus on high-impact changes)
   - Practice changes
   - Don't over-correct (maintain authenticity)

5. **Post-Communication Review and Continuous Improvement**

   Ask: "How should you **debrief after the communication**?"

   **Immediate Reflection** (within 24 hours):
   - What went well?
   - What would you do differently?
   - How did audience react? (Engagement, questions, body language)
   - Any surprises?

   Then: "What **audience feedback** should be collected?"

   **Quantitative**:
   - Survey: "On scale 1-5, how clear/inspiring/valuable was this communication?"
   - Net Promoter Score: "Would you recommend this company based on today's communication?"
   - Engagement metrics: Questions asked, chat activity (virtual), applause/energy (in-person)

   **Qualitative**:
   - Open-ended survey: "What resonated? What was unclear?"
   - One-on-one conversations: "What did you think?"
   - Social media / Slack chatter: What are people saying?

   Follow with: "How do you track **improvement over time**?"
   - Keep communication log or journal
   - Track feedback scores (aim for upward trend)
   - Save recordings (see progress)
   - Note lessons learned for next communication

   Ask: "What **continuous development** should the executive pursue?"

   **Skills Development**:
   - Media training (for interviews, press conferences)
   - Presentation skills coaching
   - Storytelling workshops
   - Improv classes (thinking on feet, authenticity)

   **Ongoing Practice**:
   - Regular town halls or all-hands (practice makes perfect)
   - Seek speaking opportunities (conferences, panels, podcasts)
   - Watch great communicators (TED talks, political speeches, CEO presentations)

**Stage 5 Output**: Present delivery coaching guide with vocal techniques (pace/volume/pitch/articulation/energy), body language coaching (posture/gestures/movement/eye contact/facial expression), executive presence principles (confidence/calm/authenticity/empathy/decisiveness), rehearsal plan (solo practice/out loud/record/mock presentation), feedback collection (content/delivery/timing), post-communication debrief (reflection/audience feedback/improvement tracking), and continuous development recommendations (media training/coaching/practice opportunities). Ask: "Does this delivery coaching and improvement framework set the executive up for powerful, authentic communication both now and over time?"

## Usage Example

### Scenario: CEO All-Hands During Company Transformation

**Stage 1: Context**

- **Executive**: Sarah Chen, CEO, 2 years tenure
  - Voice: Warm, authentic, data-driven but not dry
  - Credibility: Led successful transformation at previous company
  - Challenge: Some employees skeptical of change

- **Occasion**: Quarterly all-hands (virtual), 60 min (30 min speech + 30 min Q&A)

- **Audience**:
  - Primary: 3,000 employees (all levels, global)
  - Current state: Anxious about transformation, want clarity on what it means for them
  - Care about: Job security, company direction, their role

- **Objectives**:
  - **Think**: Understand transformation strategy and rationale
  - **Feel**: Confident in leadership, excited about future
  - **Do**: Enroll in AI training, share ideas via innovation portal

- **Key Messages**:
  1. "We're transforming from legacy software to AI-powered platform to stay competitive"
  2. "This creates opportunities for you—new skills, new roles, new impact"
  3. "I'm committed to transparency—you'll hear from me monthly, and I'll answer tough questions"

**Stage 2: Structure**

- **Opening** (Hook - personal story):
  "Seven years ago, I was at a company that didn't transform when the market shifted. We thought our customers would stick with us because they always had. But they didn't. We lost 40% market share in 2 years. I watched talented people lose jobs. I don't want that to happen here."

- **Body** (Past-Present-Future):
  1. **Where we've been**: 20 years as leader in legacy software
  2. **Where we are**: Market shifting to AI, competitors moving fast
  3. **Where we're going**: Transforming to AI-powered platform

- **Closing** (Callback + CTA):
  "I started with a story about a company that didn't change. We're not that company. We're the company that leads change. Starting Monday, AI training launches—I want 100% enrollment in 90 days. Let's build the future together."

**Stage 3: Content**

[Full speech written in Sarah's voice—conversational, uses "we," shares data but explains it plainly, includes customer story about AI impact]

**Stage 4: Q&A Prep**

- **Anticipated tough question**: "Will AI lead to layoffs?"
- **Answer**: "I'll be direct: We're not laying people off due to AI. We're redeploying. Some roles will change, and we'll train you for new roles. We're investing $10M in training—that's our commitment to you."

**Stage 5: Delivery**

- Rehearsed 5 times
- Delivery notes: Slow down when sharing data, pause after tough questions before answering (shows thoughtfulness), smile when talking about opportunities
- Post-event: 87% positive feedback, 2,500 enrolled in training within week

## Important Notes

### Executive Communications Best Practices

1. **Authenticity > Polish**: Sound like a real person, not a corporate robot
2. **Clarity > Complexity**: Simple language, clear structure
