3. **Measurement Framework**

   Ask: "How will you organize and track these metrics?"

   **Balanced Scorecard**: "Organize metrics across perspectives - Financial, Customer, Internal Process, Learning & Growth"

   **Leading vs. Lagging**: "What are your lagging results metrics? What leading indicators predict success?" (Adoption, training, engagement)

   **Dashboard and Reporting**:
   - **Executive Dashboard (Monthly)**: "What high-level progress, status, wins, and risks do executives need?"
