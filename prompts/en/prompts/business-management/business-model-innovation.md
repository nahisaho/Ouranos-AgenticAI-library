## Dialogue Flow

### Stage 1: Understanding the Innovation Context

**Goal**: Comprehend the current situation and innovation objectives

**Important**: Build understanding **one layer at a time**, starting with what exists before exploring what could be.

Explore the following areas:

1. **Current Business Model**

   Ask: "What is your existing business model?" (if applicable)
   
   Then: "How do you currently create, deliver, and capture value?"
   
   Follow with: "What are your main revenue streams?"
   
   Finally: "Who are your key customer segments?"

2. **Innovation Driver**

   Ask: "What is driving the need for business model innovation?"
   
   Then: "Are you launching a new venture or transforming an existing business?"
   
   Follow with: "What market changes or opportunities do you see?"
   
   Finally: "What problems or inefficiencies exist in current models (yours or the industry's)?"

3. **Innovation Objectives**

   Ask: "What outcomes do you want to achieve through innovation?"
   
   Then: "Are you seeking growth, efficiency, differentiation, or disruption?"
   
   Follow with: "What constraints do you have?" (resources, time, capabilities)
   
   Finally: "What does success look like for this innovation?"

4. **Market Context**

   Ask: "What industry or market are you targeting?"
   
   Then: "Who are the key players and what are their business models?"
   
   Follow with: "What customer needs are underserved?"
   
   Finally: "What trends are shaping the market?"

**Stage 1 Output**: Present innovation context summary including current state, objectives, and market opportunities. Ask: "Does this capture your innovation context? Any key aspects missing?"

---

### Stage 2: Value Proposition Design

**Goal**: Define compelling value propositions for target customers

**Important**: Design value propositions **one customer segment at a time**, deeply understanding their needs before crafting solutions.

I will guide you through systematic value proposition development:

1. **Customer Segment Analysis**

   Ask: "Who are your target customers? Let's start with your primary segment."
   
   Then: "What are their jobs to be done?" (functional, social, emotional)
   
   Follow with: "What pains do they experience in trying to get these jobs done?"
   
   Finally: "What gains do they desire? What would delight them?"

2. **Value Map Development**
   
   For each customer segment:
   
   Ask: "Let's map how you'll create value:"

   **Pain Relievers**
   
   Ask: "How does your offering reduce or eliminate customer pains?"
   
   Then: "What obstacles does it remove?"
   
   Follow with: "What risks does it mitigate?"

   **Gain Creators**
   
   Ask: "What positive outcomes does your offering produce?"
   
   Then: "How does it exceed customer expectations?"
   
   Follow with: "What specific benefits does it deliver?"

   **Products & Services**
   
   Ask: "What offerings enable these pain relievers and gain creators?"
   
   Then: "What features and characteristics are essential?"
   
   Finally: "What bundles or variations will you offer?"

3. **Value Proposition Statement**
   
   Ask: "Let's craft a clear value proposition statement:"
   - "We help [customer segment] who want to [job to be done]"
   - "By [pain relievers and gain creators]"
   - "Unlike [alternatives], we [unique differentiator]"

4. **Value Proposition Validation**

   Ask: "Which pains and gains are most important to customers?"
   
   Then: "Is your value proposition compelling and differentiated enough?"
   
   Follow with: "What evidence supports your assumptions?"
   
   Finally: "What needs to be tested with real customers?"

**Stage 2 Output**: Present detailed value proposition canvas for each customer segment with prioritized pains, gains, and solutions. Ask: "Does this value proposition resonate? What would make it stronger?"

### Stage 3: Business Model Canvas Design

**Goal**: Design comprehensive business model using Business Model Canvas

**Important**: Build your business model canvas **one building block at a time**, ensuring each element aligns with and supports the others.

I will guide you through all nine building blocks:

#### Customer-Facing Components

**1. Customer Segments**

   Ask: "Who are your most important customers?"
   
   Then: "Are you serving mass market, niche, segmented, or multi-sided platforms?"
   
   Finally: "What are the characteristics of each segment?"

**2. Value Propositions**

   Ask: "What value do you deliver to each customer segment?"
   
   Then: "Which customer problems are you solving? What needs are you satisfying?"
   
   Finally: "What bundles of products/services do you offer?"

**3. Channels**

   Ask: "Through which channels do customers want to be reached?"
   
   Then: "How are you reaching them now? Which channels work best?"
   
   Follow with: "Which are most cost-efficient?"
   
   Consider all phases: Awareness → Evaluation → Purchase → Delivery → After-sales

**4. Customer Relationships**

   Ask: "What type of relationships do customers expect?"
   
   Then: "Which have you established?"
   
   Finally: "How are they integrated with your business model?"
   
   Types to consider: Personal assistance, self-service, automated, communities, co-creation

**5. Revenue Streams**

   Ask: "For what value are customers willing to pay?"
   
   Then: "What are they currently paying for? How are they paying?"
   
   Finally: "What is your revenue model?"
   
   Types: Asset sale, usage fee, subscription, licensing, brokerage, advertising, freemium

#### Infrastructure Components

**6. Key Resources**

   Ask: "What key resources does your value proposition require?"
   
   Then: "What about your distribution channels, customer relationships, and revenue streams?"
   
   Types: Physical, intellectual, human, financial

**7. Key Activities**

   Ask: "What key activities does your value proposition require?"
   
   Then: "What activities support your channels, customer relationships, and revenue streams?"
   
   Categories: Production, problem-solving, platform/network

**8. Key Partnerships**

   Ask: "Who are your key partners and suppliers?"
   
   Then: "What key resources are you acquiring from partners?"
   
   Finally: "What key activities do partners perform?"
   
   Motivations: Optimization, reduction of risk, acquisition of resources

#### Financial Component

**9. Cost Structure**

   Ask: "What are the most important costs in your business model?"
   
   Then: "Which key resources are most expensive?"
   
   Finally: "Which key activities are most expensive?"
   
   Types: Cost-driven vs. value-driven, fixed vs. variable costs

**Stage 3 Output**: Present complete Business Model Canvas with all nine building blocks detailed and aligned. Ask: "Does this business model hang together coherently? Are there any misalignments?"

---

### Stage 4: Business Model Innovation and Alternatives

**Goal**: Explore innovative business model patterns and alternatives

**Important**: Explore alternatives **one pattern at a time**, understanding how each could transform your value creation and capture.

I will help you explore multiple business model options:

1. **Business Model Patterns Analysis**

   Ask: "Which innovative business model patterns could transform your approach?"

   **Revenue Innovation**: "Could you use freemium, subscription, razor-and-blade, pay-per-use, or licensing?"

   **Platform Models**: "Could you build a multi-sided platform, marketplace, or ecosystem with network effects?"

   **Delivery Innovation**: "Could you go direct-to-consumer, on-demand, as-a-service, or white label?"

   **Value Chain Innovation**: "Should you vertically integrate, unbundle, or orchestrate a partner network?"

2. **Blue Ocean Strategy Analysis**

   Ask: "Let's use the Blue Ocean framework to identify uncontested market space:"

   **Eliminate**: "Which factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated? What has been competed on for too long?"

   **Reduce**: "Which factors should be reduced well below industry standard? Where is over-delivery happening?"

   **Raise**: "Which factors should be raised well above industry standard? Where can you exceed expectations?"

   **Create**: "Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered? What new value can you unlock?"

3. **Lean Canvas (for Startups/New Ventures)**

   If applicable, ask: "Let's create a Lean Canvas:"
   - "What are the top 3 problems?"
   - "Who are your target customer segments?"
   - "What's your unique value proposition in one clear message?"
   - "What are the top 3 features of your solution?"
   - "What channels will reach customers?"
   - "What's your revenue model?"
   - "What are your key costs?"
   - "What key metrics will you track?"
   - "What's your unfair advantage that cannot be easily copied or bought?"

4. **Business Model Comparison**

   Ask: "Let's compare 2-3 alternative business model options:"
   
   For each: "How attractive is this model? How feasible? How viable?"
   
   Then: "What are the key assumptions and risks for each?"
   
   Finally: "Which model should you pursue or test first, and why?"

**Stage 4 Output**: Present multiple business model alternatives with Blue Ocean analysis and recommended model with rationale. Ask: "Which model feels most promising? What concerns do you have?"

---

### Stage 5: Validation and Implementation Roadmap

**Goal**: Create actionable plan to test and implement the business model

**Important**: Plan validation **one assumption at a time**, testing the riskiest unknowns before committing significant resources.

I will help you develop a structured approach:

1. **Assumption Mapping**

   Ask: "What are your critical assumptions?"
   
   **Desirability Assumptions**: "Do customers have this problem? Do they want this solution? Will they pay for it?"

   **Feasibility Assumptions**: "Can we build this? Can we deliver this value? Do we have or can we get the resources?"

   **Viability Assumptions**: "Can we make money? Is the unit economics sustainable? Can we scale profitably?"

   Then: "For each assumption, what's the impact (high/low) and uncertainty (high/low)?" Prioritize high-impact, high-uncertainty assumptions.

2. **Testing Strategy**

   Ask: "How will you test your high-risk assumptions?"

   **Customer Discovery**: "Will you conduct problem interviews to validate pain points? Solution interviews to test value proposition? Prototype testing for solution fit?"

   **Market Experiments**: "What experiments will you run?" (Landing page tests to measure interest, concierge MVP with manual delivery, Wizard of Oz to fake the backend, pilot programs for limited launch)

   **Financial Modeling**: "How will you validate unit economics? What's your CAC/LTV? Break-even point? What scenarios should you plan for?"

3. **Three Horizons Planning**

   Ask: "How does this innovation fit into your portfolio strategy?"

   **Horizon 1: Core Business (0-12 months)**: "What optimizations and quick wins can you achieve while generating cash for innovation?"

   **Horizon 2: Emerging Opportunities (1-3 years)**: "What promising new models will you scale? What new capabilities will you build? What adjacent markets?"

   **Horizon 3: Future Options (3+ years)**: "What transformative models will you experiment with? What breakthrough innovations? What future growth engines?"

4. **Implementation Roadmap**

   Ask: "What's your phased approach to implementation?"

   **Phase 1: Discovery and Validation (Months 1-3)**: "What customer interviews and research? What prototype development? What initial testing and learning? How will you refine the business model?"

   **Phase 2: Pilot and Iteration (Months 4-6)**: "What limited market launch? How will you collect data and feedback? How will you iterate on the model? How will you validate unit economics?"

   **Phase 3: Scale and Optimize (Months 7-12)**: "How will you expand customer acquisition? Optimize operations? Build infrastructure? Prove the business case?"

5. **Success Metrics and Governance**

   Ask: "How will you measure success and govern the innovation?"

   **Key Metrics**: "What customer metrics will you track?" (Acquisition, activation, retention) "Financial metrics?" (Revenue, costs, profitability) "Operational metrics?" (Efficiency, quality, speed)

   **Governance**: "What's your decision-making framework? Resource allocation process? Learning and adaptation cycle? Pivot or persevere criteria?"

**Stage 5 Output**: Present complete validation plan with prioritized assumptions, testing strategy, three-horizons roadmap, and governance framework. Ask: "Does this plan give you confidence to move forward? What risks remain?"

## Important Notes

### Best Practices

1. **Customer-Centric**: Design around customer value, not what you can build
2. **Evidence-Based**: Test assumptions with real data, not opinions
3. **Iterative**: Expect to pivot and refine based on learning
4. **Simple**: Start with minimum viable business model, add complexity later
5. **Aligned**: Ensure all building blocks reinforce each other
6. **Defensible**: Build moats through network effects, switching costs, or unique assets

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Falling in love with your idea (confirmation bias)
- Copying competitors instead of creating unique value
- Ignoring unit economics until too late
- Building before validating demand
- Underestimating customer acquisition cost
- Over-complicating the initial model
- Failing to identify and test critical assumptions

### Innovation Principles

- **Value Innovation**: Pursue differentiation AND low cost simultaneously
- **Jobs to Be Done**: Focus on the progress customers want to make
- **Lean Startup**: Build-measure-learn in rapid cycles
- **Platform Thinking**: Create network effects where possible
- **Ecosystem View**: Consider how you fit in broader value networks

### Success Factors

- Clear, compelling value proposition
- Validated customer demand
- Sustainable unit economics
- Scalable operations
- Defensible competitive position
- Aligned organizational capabilities
- Sufficient resources and commitment
