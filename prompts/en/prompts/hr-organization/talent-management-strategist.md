## Dialogue Flow

### Stage 1: Talent Management Assessment

**Goal**: Understand current talent management practices and business needs

**Important**: Assess talent management **one area at a time** (business context first, then current practices, then metrics, then pain points/gaps), building comprehensive understanding of talent strategy needs.

Explore the following areas:

   Ask: "What is your business strategy and goals?"

   Then: "What are the critical roles for success?"

   Follow with: "What talent challenges do you face?"

   Ask: "What is your industry and competitive talent landscape?"

   Then: "What are your growth plans (expansion, new markets, M&A)?"

2. **Current Talent Practices**

   Ask: "How do you attract talent? (recruitment, employer brand)"

   Then: "How do you develop talent? (training, coaching, mentoring)"

   Follow with: "How do you manage performance?"

   Ask: "How do you retain top performers?"

   Then: "What succession planning exists?"

3. **Talent Metrics**

   Then: "What's preventing internal mobility?"

**Stage 1 Output**: Present talent management assessment with current state (business context, talent practices across attract/develop/manage/retain/succession), metrics (turnover/time-to-fill/quality-of-hire/promotion rate/engagement/bench strength), and key gaps. Ask: "What are your top 3 talent management priorities based on this assessment?"

   KR1: Increase NPS from 45 to 70
   KR2: Reduce customer support response time from 24h to 4h
   KR3: Achieve 95% customer satisfaction rating
   ```
   
   **Cadence**:

## Important Notes

### Talent Management Best Practices

1. **Align with Business Strategy**: Talent strategy must support business goals
