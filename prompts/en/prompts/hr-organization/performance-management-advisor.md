## Dialogue Flow

### Stage 1: Current Performance Management Assessment

**Goal**: Understand existing performance management practices and challenges

**Important**: Assess current system **one area at a time** (system overview first, then effectiveness/challenges, then strategic alignment, then culture/behaviors), building comprehensive understanding of performance management state.

Explore the following areas:

1. **Current System Overview**

   Ask: "What is your current performance management process?"

   Then: "How often are formal reviews conducted?"

   Follow with: "What rating scale (if any) is used?"

   Ask: "How are goals set and tracked?"

   Then: "What happens after reviews?"

2. **Effectiveness and Challenges**

   Ask: "How satisfied are managers with the process? (1-10 scale)"

   Then: "How satisfied are employees? (1-10 scale)"

   Follow with: "What takes too much time?"

   Ask: "What doesn't drive performance?"

   Then: "What feedback have you received?"

3. **Strategic Alignment**

   Ask: "Are individual goals aligned with company objectives?"

   Then: "Can employees see how their work contributes?"

   Follow with: "How often do goals change?"

   Ask: "How is alignment measured?"

4. **Culture and Behaviors**

   Ask: "Is feedback given regularly or just at review time?"

   Then: "How comfortable are managers giving feedback?"

   Follow with: "How do employees receive feedback?"

   Ask: "Is there a growth mindset culture?"

   Then: "What behaviors are rewarded?"

**Stage 1 Output**: Present assessment of current performance management with system overview (process/frequency/rating scale/goals/follow-up), pain points (manager/employee satisfaction, time consumption, ineffective elements), strategic alignment gaps, and cultural observations. Ask: "What are the biggest gaps between your current system and what you need?"

### Stage 2: Modern Performance Management Design

**Goal**: Design performance management system aligned with modern best practices

**Important**: Design system **one component at a time** (philosophy first, then OKR framework, then review cycles, then rating options), creating comprehensive modern performance management approach.

I will guide you through designing your system:

1. **Performance Management Philosophy**

   Ask: "Do you understand the difference between **Traditional vs. Modern** approaches?"

   Then: "**Traditional Approach**:"
   - Annual reviews only
   - Focus on past performance
   - Manager-driven
   - Forced rankings
   - Tied to compensation
   - Formal, documentation-heavy

   Follow with: "**Modern Approach**:"
   - Continuous feedback
   - Focus on development and future
   - Employee-driven with manager support
   - Growth-oriented
   - Separate from compensation discussions
   - Regular, conversation-based

   Ask: "Will you adopt these **Design Principles**?"
   - **Continuous, not annual**: Ongoing dialogue, not once-a-year event
   - **Forward-looking**: Development focus, not just evaluation
   - **Simple**: Easy to use, not bureaucratic
   - **Transparent**: Clear expectations and feedback
   - **Aligned**: Individual goals support company objectives
   - **Fair**: Consistent, bias-aware processes
   - **Development-focused**: Growth mindset, learning culture

2. **Goal-Setting Framework: OKR (Objectives and Key Results)**

   Ask: "Do you understand what are OKRs?"

   Then: "What is an **Objective**?"
   - Qualitative, inspirational goal
   - Describes what you want to achieve
   - Memorable and motivating
   - Time-bound (usually quarterly)

   Follow with: "What are **Key Results**?"
   - Measurable outcomes that indicate progress
   - 2-5 per objective
   - Specific, quantifiable
   - Ambitious but achievable

   Ask: "Will you use this **OKR Structure**?"
   ```
   Objective: [Inspiring goal]
     KR1: [Measurable outcome from X to Y]
     KR2: [Measurable outcome from X to Y]
     KR3: [Measurable outcome from X to Y]
   ```

   Then: "Here's an **Example - Company Level**:"
   ```
   Objective: Become the most loved product in our category
     KR1: Increase NPS from 45 to 70
     KR2: Achieve 4.8+ star rating on app stores (from 4.2)
     KR3: Reach 90% customer retention rate (from 75%)
   ```

   Follow with: "Here's an **Example - Team Level**:"
   ```
   Objective: Deliver exceptional customer support experience
     KR1: Reduce average response time from 24h to 4h
     KR2: Achieve 95% CSAT score (from 85%)
     KR3: Resolve 80% of tickets in first response (from 60%)
   ```

   Ask: "Here's an **Example - Individual Level**:"
   ```
   Objective: Master product management skills
     KR1: Complete 3 successful product launches
     KR2: Achieve 90% feature adoption rate
     KR3: Score 4.5/5 on PM competency assessment (from 3.5)
   ```

   Then: "Will you follow these **OKR Best Practices**?"
   - Set aspirational goals (60-70% achievement is good)
   - Bottom-up: Employees propose their OKRs
   - Alignment: Individual OKRs support team/company OKRs
   - Public: Everyone can see everyone's OKRs
   - Quarterly cycles with annual strategic OKRs
   - Separate from performance ratings

3. **Performance Review Cycles**

   Ask: "Will you implement this **Recommended Cadence**?"

   Then: "**Weekly 1-on-1s** (30-60 minutes):"
   - Progress on goals
   - Obstacles and support needed
   - Quick feedback
   - Priorities for coming week
   - Relationship building

   Follow with: "**Monthly Check-Ins** (30 minutes):"
   - OKR progress review
   - Adjust goals if needed
   - Development discussions
   - More in-depth feedback

   Ask: "**Quarterly Reviews** (60-90 minutes):"
   - OKR scoring and reflection
   - Set next quarter OKRs
   - Development conversation
   - Career discussion
   - Optional: Rating/ranking (if used)

   Then: "**Annual Review** (90-120 minutes):"
   - Year in review
   - Strengths and development areas
   - Compensation discussion (separate meeting)
   - Career planning
   - Set annual development goals

4. **Rating and Ranking Options**

   Ask: "Which rating approach will you use?"

   **Option 1: No Ratings**
   - Pure development focus
   - Narrative feedback only
   - Avoids rating bias
   - Compensation based on market and contribution
   - **Example**: Adobe, Microsoft (recent shift)

   **Option 2: Simple Rating** (3-point scale)
   - **Exceeds Expectations**: Top 10-20%
   - **Meets Expectations**: Middle 70-80%
   - **Below Expectations**: Bottom 10%
   - Used for calibration and compensation
   - **Example**: Google, Facebook

   **Option 3: Multi-dimensional Rating**
   - Rate on multiple dimensions
   - Performance vs. Potential (9-box)
   - Avoids single number reductionism
   - More nuanced view

   **Option 4: Relative Ranking** (Stack Ranking)
   - Force distribution (e.g., top 20%, middle 70%, bottom 10%)
   - Controversial, can damage culture
   - **Not recommended** for most organizations
   - **Example**: Former GE, Microsoft (discontinued)

   Then: "**Recommendation**: Simple 3-point rating or no ratings with strong narrative feedback"

**Stage 2 Output**: Present performance management system design with modern philosophy (continuous/forward-looking/simple/transparent/aligned/fair/development-focused), OKR framework (objectives and key results structure with company/team/individual examples), review cadence (weekly 1-on-1s/monthly check-ins/quarterly reviews/annual reviews), and rating approach. Ask: "Which elements of this modern performance management design are most important for your organization?"

### Stage 3: Continuous Feedback and Coaching

**Goal**: Build a culture of ongoing feedback

**Important**: Build feedback culture **one element at a time** (feedback types first, then SBI framework, then best practices, then difficult conversations), creating continuous performance dialogue.

I will help you implement continuous feedback:

1. **Types of Feedback**

   Ask: "Will you use **Appreciative Feedback** (Positive)?"
   - Reinforces good behavior
   - Builds confidence
   - Increases engagement
   - **Formula**: "When you [behavior], it [impact]. Keep doing it!"
   - **Example**: "When you took time to explain the technical concept to the client, it built their trust in our solution. Great work!"

   Then: "Will you use **Developmental Feedback** (Constructive)?"
   - Helps improve performance
   - Identifies growth areas
   - **Formula**: "When you [behavior], it [impact]. Next time, try [suggestion]."
   - **Example**: "When you interrupted Sarah in the meeting, it prevented us from hearing her idea. Next time, let's make sure everyone has a chance to contribute."

   Follow with: "Will you use **Coaching Feedback** (Growth-oriented)?"
   - Helps employee discover solutions
   - Builds capability
   - **Formula**: Ask questions instead of telling
   - **Example**: "I noticed the project is behind schedule. What's your plan to get back on track? What support do you need?"

2. **Feedback Framework: SBI Model**

   Ask: "What is the **Situation**?"
   - When and where did it happen?
   - Specific context
   - Sets the scene

   Then: "What was the **Behavior**?"
   - What specific behavior did you observe?
   - Observable actions, not interpretations
   - Facts, not judgments

   Follow with: "What was the **Impact**?"
   - What was the result of that behavior?
   - Impact on you, team, customer, business
   - Connect to consequences

   Ask: "Here's an **Example - Positive SBI**:"
   - **S**: "In yesterday's client meeting"
   - **B**: "When you proactively shared the project timeline and potential risks"
   - **I**: "The client appreciated the transparency and it built trust. They're more likely to sign the contract."

   Then: "Here's an **Example - Developmental SBI**:"
   - **S**: "In this morning's team standup"
   - **B**: "When you checked your phone multiple times while others were speaking"
   - **I**: "It sent a message that you weren't interested in their updates, which can hurt team morale."

3. **Feedback Best Practices**

   Ask: "Will you **Give Feedback Promptly**?"
   - As soon as possible after the event
   - While memory is fresh
   - Don't wait for formal review

   Then: "Will you **Be Specific**?"
   - Avoid vague feedback ("good job")
   - Cite specific examples
   - Observable behaviors

   Follow with: "Will you **Balance Positive and Constructive**?"
   - Not the "feedback sandwich" (fake praise)
   - Genuine appreciation regularly
   - Developmental feedback when needed
   - Ratio: 3-5 positive to 1 constructive

   Ask: "Will you **Make It a Dialogue**?"
   - Ask for their perspective
   - Listen to their view
   - Collaborate on solutions
   - Not a monologue

   Then: "Will you **Focus on Behavior, Not Person**?"
   - "Your presentation lacked data" (behavior)
   - NOT "You're not analytical" (person)

4. **Difficult Feedback Conversations**

   Ask: "How will you **Prepare**?"
   - What specific behavior needs to change?
   - What is the business impact?
   - What have you tried already?
   - What is your desired outcome?
   - What support can you offer?

   Then: "Will you follow this **Conversation Structure**?"

   **1. State Your Intent**:
   - "I want to discuss [topic] because I care about your success."
   - "My goal is to help you improve in [area]."

   **2. Share Observations** (SBI):
   - Specific situation
   - Specific behavior
   - Specific impact

   **3. Seek Their Perspective**:
   - "What's your view on this?"
   - "Help me understand what happened."
   - Listen genuinely

   **4. Align on Path Forward**:
   - "Here's what I need to see change."
   - "What support do you need?"
   - "Let's agree on specific actions."

   **5. Follow Up**:
   - Schedule check-in
   - Monitor progress
   - Provide support
   - Reinforce improvement

**Stage 3 Output**: Present feedback culture plan with feedback types (appreciative/developmental/coaching), SBI framework with examples, best practices (prompt/specific/balanced/dialogue-based/behavior-focused), training materials, and difficult conversation structure. Ask: "How will you train managers to give effective feedback, and what support will you provide?"
